# Data dictionary

Data files for "Alternative protein in Vietnam: a supply-side scoping study" (AltProtein Vietnam, September 2026; files added in versions 0.2 to 0.5 listed at the end). All files are UTF-8 CSV with one header row and snake_case column names. Every row carries a stable `record_id` (or `source_id`, `oq_id`, `dg_id`). Source IDs in `source_ids` resolve to `sources.csv`.

Built on 23 September 2026 by the data consolidation step from the wave 1 and wave 2 research outputs (see `working-papers/`). Where wave 2 changed a wave 1 value, the change is recorded in `change_log` (companies, facilities, instruments) or in `origin` and `notes` (routes, policy options, publications).

**Common columns.** `source_ids`: semicolon-separated source IDs. `evidence_label`: VN-direct, VN-adjacent or general. `confidence`: High, Medium or Low. `province_current` and `province_former`: added by the consolidation step using `provinces.csv` (former_units); left blank when the location is vague, flagged as assumed or unverified, or ambiguous.

**Province method.** A location is mapped only when it names a current or former province, or a district, town or industrial park that lies wholly inside one former unit (for example District 12 and Vinh Loc in former Ho Chi Minh City, Phu My in former Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Can Duoc in former Long An). Multi-site entries list each site when every site resolves.

### Changes to existing files in the synthesis step
- **policy_options.csv:** added `report_rank` (1 to 24, as ranked in chapter 27) and `report_tier` (1, 2, 3 or `superseded`); added PO-026 to PO-033 (origin "synthesis"); filled `impact` for PO-015 to PO-025 with the synthesis judgement (High, Medium or Low).
- **open_questions.csv:** added `priority_rank` (1 to 20, as ranked in chapter 30) and `unblocks` (plays or public goods each question affects); added OQ-127.

### Changes to existing files in v0.2
- **sources.csv:** 469 rows appended (waves 3 to 5); rows `QNT-model`, `NGF-calc` and `AQF-calc` record our calculation scripts and are not cited with `[@...]`.
- **open_questions.csv:** OQ-128 to OQ-155 added (topic "futures 2030 to 2050"); OQ-127 set to "partly closed" (Decision 1625 indicates livestock feed only).
- **disagreements.csv:** DG-143 to DG-170 added (futures round).

### charts/data/
Small chart-ready tables built from the chapters for charts whose data are not already in one file (see `charts/chart-specs.json`). Each has a `source_ids` column where applicable.


## Files added in the futures round (v0.2)

Built on 2026-09-24 by `research/wave3/consolidate_wave3.py` from the futures-round research streams (wave3: FTG, FTB, CLM, QNT, GEO, ECF, HSC, NTS; wave4: NGF, AQF, HUB; wave5: VIS). The research notes, CSVs and scripts are in `working-papers/wave3/`. Values are as the research agents wrote them. Cleaning only: UTF-8 with LF line endings, snake_case column names, no em or en dashes, `evidence_label` as the evidence column name, and a `record_id` first column (kept from the stream where it had one, otherwise a short prefix plus the row number in the stream's row order). Forward-looking values carry a `foresight_type` label (trend, projection, estimate, signal, wildcard or vision); our own estimates are what-if results, not forecasts.

**Sources.** 469 source rows were appended to `sources.csv` (and the identical copy in `sources/`), marked `wave3`, `wave4` or `wave5` in the `wave` column, with `from_note` pointing to the stream's notes; `sources.csv` now has 1275 rows. `source_type` is mapped from the agent's stated type, which is kept in `notes` as "Type as given". Rows that share a URL or DOI with another row say so in `notes`. The IDs QNT-model, NGF-calc and AQF-calc name our own calculations; they do not match the citation token pattern and cannot be cited as `[@ID]`.

**Balance model.** `tools/balance_model.py` is the QNT model with package paths: it reads `data/balance_assumptions.csv` and rewrites `data/balance_outputs.csv` and `data/balance_sensitivity.csv` (run `python3 tools/balance_model.py`). Checked on 2026-09-24: it reproduces both files exactly.
