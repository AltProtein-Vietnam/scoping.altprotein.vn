# M5. Changelog and corrections

This report is a draft. Version 1.0 will be the public launch; every version before it is a draft for review, numbered 0.x. This appendix is the record of what changed between drafts, so the chapters themselves can read cleanly. Readers who used an earlier draft should update to the values below.

## M5.1 Versions

| Version | Date | What it added | Earlier label |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | September 2026 | The supply study: context, supply, the plays, policy options, the 2035 outlook and the open questions, with the appendices on feedstocks, retail audit, companies, facilities, regulation, feed market, costs, science, research, labs, capital, the region, the administrative map and the registers | Circulated as "edition 1.0" |
| 0.2 | September 2026 | Futures to 2050: drivers, frontier technology, the protein and feed balance model, four 2050 worlds, a labelled vision and robust moves; the foresight tag | "Edition 1.1" |
| 0.3 | September 2026 | The demand side: diet and prices, chay, consumers, frontier demand, channels, business buyers, export, the demand model, product targets and demand moves; the demand evidence tag | "Edition 1.2" |
| 0.4 | September 2026 | A check of the demand side against 80 named actors and sixteen follow-up research lines, with corrections across the report | "Edition 1.3" |
| 0.5 | September 2026 | A prologue for newcomers in English and Vietnamese; a complete bibliography | "Edition 1.4" |
| 0.6 | September 2026 | A reader-first restructure, 0.x version numbers, this changelog, a two-minute summary, an FAQ, draft labels and consistency fixes (M5.2) | |
| 0.7 | September 2026 | A citation check of every source the report cites, with corrections across the report, a repaired source register and 70 new open questions (M5.13) | This draft |

Files, zips and project notes made before v0.6 use the earlier labels.

## M5.2 What changed in v0.6

No finding changed. The changes are to structure and readability:

- **Reader-first structure.** The 30 chapters are regrouped into five parts in the order a reader needs them: I Context, II Supply, III Demand, IV Futures and V What to do. Chapters are renumbered 1 to 30. Appendices are re-coded by theme: M (method and record), S (context and supply evidence), D (demand evidence), F (futures evidence) and R (registers). Every link, section number and reference was rewritten; M5.3 maps old to new.
- **Versions.** The earlier "editions 1.0 to 1.4" are now versions 0.1 to 0.5 (M5.1).
- **Markers moved here.** Notes in the text such as "new in edition 1.2" or "corrected in edition 1.3" were removed so pages read cleanly; what each version added is in M5.4, and each correction is in M5.5 to M5.12. Data files keep a version column (for example `version` in `key-numbers.json`).
- **New pages.** A two-minute summary ([[front-two-minute]]) and an FAQ ([[front-faq]]).
- **Draft labels.** The cover, the summaries and every page footer say "Draft for review, not for citation".
- **Reading aids.** How to read now has a map of the parts and a table of codes and scenario names; the executive summaries and at a glance follow the new part order; the briefs end with a "Read next" list.
- **Consistency fixes** from a reader review, listed in M5.2.1.

### M5.2.1 Consistency fixes in v0.6

These fix how things read or add up. None changes a finding.

- **Key numbers.** A duplicate key-number id was renamed (the 2023 food protein ingredient imports are now `kn-food-protein-ingredient-imports-2023`). The two retail protein price tiles are kept as separate observations (23 and 24 September 2026) and Chapter 9 now points to the wider 24 September check. The 2030 feed-target tile now says which feed the target covers. The retail price tile was removed from the startups brief, where it did not fit the text.
- **Counts.** Stale counts of open questions and disagreements in Chapter 30, Appendix R1 and Appendix S9 were brought up to date, as were the source, table and page counts on the cover and in the summaries. The plays are "ten" everywhere; "sixteen" refers only to the research lines of the actor check.
- **Law timing.** Every page now states the Food Safety Law window the same way: first comments in October 2026, a vote considered in May 2027, so a new-food clause needs to be in the draft revised between the two sessions, in practice by early 2027.
- **Codes.** Play, policy-option, demand-move and scenario codes are spelled out on first use in the summaries and briefs, and decoded in a table in [[front-how-to-read]].
- **Summaries and reading times.** 29 page summaries were shortened to one or two sentences, and every reading time was recomputed from the word count.
- **Briefs.** The six briefs now follow the new part order and end with a "Read next" list.
- **Terms and spelling.** TVP (textured vegetable protein) is defined where first used; spelling is British English throughout (for example yoghurt, sulphate); 13 abbreviations used in the report (HS code, MFN, ACFTA, RCEP, ATIGA, EVFTA and UKVFTA, CPTPP, FOB, CIF, IFS and BRCGS, ASC, TCVN, SFA) were added to [[app-r3-glossary]], which now has 236 terms.
- **Clean text.** Raw tag tokens that had leaked into running text were removed; the headings of [[app-s13-science]] are numbered; related-page links were added where pages cite each other but did not link.
- **Section codes.** Old appendix letters used as section codes inside three appendices now use the new codes: [[app-s5-facilities]] (was F1 to F9), [[app-s6-feed-market]] (was H1 to H13) and [[app-s12-costs]] (was I1 to I17). The futures question tree in [[app-m2-futures-method]] is Q1 to Q10, and the 2035 scenarios are Scenarios 1 to 3. The feedstock sheet codes C1 to C34 in [[app-s4-feedstocks]] are kept as identifiers.
- **Checks of the restructure.** An independent review of the renumbering restored one legal citation it had caught (Appendix I of Decree 111/2021), corrected two part ranges in the Vietnamese executive summary, one section reference in Chapter 24 and four section ranges in `actor_questions.csv`, and put the reading paths in `site-manifest.json` into part order. Tariff chapter numbers (HS chapters) were checked and are unchanged. The balance and demand models reproduce their published outputs byte for byte.

The working papers in `working-papers/` are kept as written, so they use the earlier chapter numbers and appendix letters.

## M5.4 What each earlier version added

**v0.2 (futures).** New chapters on drivers, frontier technology, the protein and feed balance, the 2050 worlds, the vision and robust moves (now chapters 20 to 24 and 28), and Appendices M2 and F2 to F6. Futures sections were added to the executive summaries, at a glance, the cover, how to read and the six briefs. New tag: the foresight tag; new callouts: "Speculative" and "Vision, not forecast". Smaller edits corrected and cross-linked the knowledge, outlook and unknowns chapters and the directory, feed-market, research, regulation and science appendices; the registers gained the new rows. Corrections are in M5.9.

**v0.3 (demand).** New chapters on diet and prices, chay, consumers, frontier demand, channels, business buyers, export, demand sizing and product targets (now chapters 11 to 18 and 25), and Appendices M3 and D1 to D8. New tag: the demand evidence tag; new script: `tools/demand_model.py`. `plays.csv` was unchanged; the demand view of market pull is in `play_demand_check.csv`. An independent review corrected the draft before release (M5.10).

**v0.4 (actor check).** The demand side was checked against 80 named actors and expanded in three waves of research lines (now chapter 29 and Appendix M4). The check changed the school, textured-protein, blends, label, sugar-tax, export and funder conclusions and edited chapters 7 to 9, 11 to 19 and 25 to 27, several appendices, the summaries and the briefs. The demand model's numbers were frozen, with caveats stated beside them, and the plays' scores were unchanged. 50 data files were added. An independent review corrected the draft before release (M5.11).

**v0.5 (prologue).** A prologue for newcomers in English and Vietnamese, two charts, four key numbers, 81 sources and 11 glossary terms; the bibliography was completed to list every source (M5.12).

Sections M5.5 to M5.8 list corrections to the internal scoping drafts that preceded v0.1. Their claims were treated as leads and re-checked ([[app-m1-method]]); the corrections supersede the earlier figures everywhere. Sections M5.9 to M5.12 list the corrections and changes made in each later version.

## M5.9 Corrections made in v0.2

Version 0.2 (September 2026) adds Part IV and corrects these v0.1 statements.

| Topic | Version 0.1 | Version 0.2 | Sources | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scope of the 2030 industrial feed target (30 to 32 Mt) | Unclear whether aquafeed is included (OQ-127) | Livestock feed only, per the feed scheme (Decision 1625/QD-TTg, December 2023), Medium confidence; the 2025 target of 24 to 25 Mt was probably missed; the balance model gives 26.4 Mt of livestock feed in 2030 | [@NTS-23; @MAC-28] | [[ch19-outlook-2035]], [[ch22-protein-balance-2050]], [[app-s6-feed-market]] |

## M5.10 Changes made in v0.3

Version 0.3 (September 2026) adds Part III and makes these changes to how earlier material should be read. No v0.2 number is replaced.

| Topic | Version 0.2 | Version 0.3 | Sources | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scope | Consumer demand and market forecasts out of scope, except business-to-business demand | Demand added as a design input in Part III; demand routes sized as labelled scenarios; still no market-size forecast and no marketing plan | [@CON-02; @BUY-02] | [[front-how-to-read]], [[app-m3-demand-method]] |
| S-ALT food side | A what-if share of meat replaced (1% in 2030 to 10% in 2050) | Read as exploratory: no documented demand route reaches it; a benchmark path displaces about 0.2% of meat protein by 2035 (our demand model) | [@GLB-09; @GLB-10; @GLB-19] | [[ch22-protein-balance-2050]], [[ch18-demand-sizing]] |
| Market pull of plays T1 and T10 | 4 and 3 | Demand view 5 and 4; `plays.csv` unchanged, demand view in `play_demand_check.csv` | [@BUY-02; @BUY-16] | [[ch26-plays]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |
| GFI APAC survey frame | "Vietnam included in a six-country survey" | The Vietnam sample (n = 1,049) is an online panel in the Hanoi region and Ho Chi Minh City; one working paper described it as Ho Chi Minh City only | [@CON-02; @CON-03] | [[ch13-consumers]], [[app-r2-disagreements]] |

### Corrections from the independent review of Part III

Before release, an independent reviewer re-checked Part III against the working papers, the data files and the model outputs ([[app-m3-demand-method]], section M3.6). These are the draft statements it corrected.

| Topic | Draft of Part III | Version 0.3 as released | Sources | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price of plant proteins shipped from China | USD 1.2 to 2.2 per kg | About USD 0.9 to 1.3 per kg (China-reported 2025 unit values for HS 3504, 1109 and 2106.10; about USD 1.1 on average). USD 1.76 to 2.20 was the price of seven sampled isolate shipments, not of the whole tonnage | [@BUY-02; @BUY-07] | [[ch16-business-buyers]], [[front-exec-summary]], [[brief-investors]] |
| Meat protein displaced by technology routes, 2035 | 0.2 to 0.7% | 0.1 to 0.4% for hybrids, canteens and analogues; 0.2 to 0.7% only when added chay days are included (demand model outputs, `demand_outputs.csv`) | [@BUY-02; @CHY-06] | [[brief-international]], [[ch18-demand-sizing]] |

| Protein claims on chay foods | No chay food makes a protein claim | No chay food carries a numeric protein claim or a protein claim in its name; one chay dumpling pack says its protein is 100% plant | [@FORM-01] | [[brief-manufacturers]], [[app-d3-retail-demand-signals]] |
| Cultivated meat sold in Singapore | Thousands of servings | Tens of thousands: more than 2,000 servings from one firm (by May 2024) and more than 25,000 dishes from another (April 2024 to August 2025), both company-reported | [@NOV-10; @NOV-14] | [[ch14-frontier-demand]], [[front-exec-summary]], [[brief-investors]] |
| Retail textured soy against the border price | 8 to 12 times | About 10 to 16 times the 2025 unit value for HS 2106.10 (our calculation; the supply chapters' 8 to 12 times uses the 2023 unit value) | [@BUY-02; @FORM-01] | [[ch16-business-buyers]], [[app-s2-retail-audit]] |
| Diaspora chay pack prices in the US | USD 3.50 to 9.00 | USD 3.50 to 10 | [@EXP-37] | [[ch17-export-demand]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |

| Ratios from the demand model | Delivered protein ten times displaced protein; S-ALT feed four to five times food | About eight times in 2035; about four times | `demand_outputs.csv` (demand model) | [[ch18-demand-sizing]] |
| Plays that lead under the weight presets | T1, T2 and T4 lead under almost every weighting | T4 is first or second under every preset; with the demand view, T1 leads four of the seven presets; T5 is second under the policy, research and international presets | `plays.csv`, `play_weight_presets.csv`, `play_demand_check.csv` | [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |
| Vinasoy's share of soy milk | About 90% (labelled as our derivation) | 90.6% of branded soy milk in 2024 (Bao Viet Securities), shown beside the supply chapters' about 80% of all soy milk | [@CON-27; @ECO-41] | [[ch12-chay-baseline]], [[ch13-consumers]] |
| Demand evidence tags | Functional ingredient tests tagged as tested demand; firm actions and official messaging tagged as stated; one calculation under a High, revealed tag | Functional tests carry no demand tag; firm actions are revealed; calculations are inferred and Low; two tariff key numbers carry no demand tag | None needed (tagging change; affected claims in the pages listed) | [[ch11-protein-diet]], [[ch14-frontier-demand]], [[ch15-channels]], [[ch16-business-buyers]] |

## M5.11 Changes made in v0.4

Version 0.4 (September 2026) checks Part III against 80 named actors and adds the results of sixteen research lines ([[ch29-actor-check]], [[app-m4-actor-check-waves]]). These are the v0.3 statements it corrects or replaces. The demand model's inputs and outputs are unchanged; see [[ch18-demand-sizing]] for how the corrections bear on them.

| Topic | Version 0.3 | Version 0.4 | Sources | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Food Safety Law timing | Expected at the October to November 2026 session | First comments at the October 2026 session; passage considered at the May 2027 session; the window for a new-food clause runs into early 2027 (our inference) | [@APR-07; @APR-08] | [[ch07-rules]], [[ch27-policy-options]], [[ch19-outlook-2035]], briefs, summaries |
| School meals and protein | Guided by an animal-protein target (Decision 1340, 2016); plant protein in schools runs against it; do not start in schools | Decision 1340 targets ended in 2020. Decision 3958/QĐ-BYT (December 2025) sets no animal share and asks for legumes or tofu at least twice a week; menus we audited meet it in 9 of 48 weeks and fill it with tofu beside meat; menu software prints a 48% animal-protein standard. Only a labelled blend in minced dishes removes meat | [@APR-04; @PMR-10; @PMR-26; @CHN-33] | [[ch15-channels]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |
| Tariff protection | MFN duties of 3 to 10% give domestic makers a little protection | Chinese, ASEAN and Korean protein ingredients enter at 0% under ACFTA, ATIGA, AKFTA and RCEP; MFN applies only to other origins | [@FTR-32; @FTR-33] | [[ch16-business-buyers]], [[ch07-rules]], [[app-s9-regulation]], [[app-s12-costs]] |
| Domestic textured protein (T1) | Equipment USD 1.5 to 4 million per line (assumption); benchmark path supports three to four lines; a startup thesis | Chinese lines listed at USD 11,000 to 100,000 (models of 200 to 1,500 kg/h), installed USD 0.3 to 1.4 million (our estimate); flour price decides the margin; about one soy line by 2035; best owned by an incumbent or distributor and debt-financed | [@TIC-02; @TIC-12; @TIC-13] | [[ch09-economics]], [[ch26-plays]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]], [[brief-investors]] |
| Chinese textured protein price | About USD 1.6 per kg (2023) before freight and duty | USD 1.24 per kg FOB (2025), landed about USD 1.29 to 1.38 per kg | [@BUY-02; @TIC-12] | [[ch09-economics]], [[ch16-business-buyers]] |
| Blends (T9, TPP-03) | An extender must cost less than the lean meat it replaces; 20 to 30% replacement, up to 50% | Soy extension already pays at every annual hog price from 2019 to 2024 (our calculation), so a new extender must beat hydrated soy; 10 to 20% in fine emulsions, 30% in coarse mince; avoid the *độn* (filler) frame | [@DIE-25; @TRU-02; @HXE-04; @HXE-09; @HXE-12] | [[ch14-frontier-demand]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |
| Label moves | Define chay; require percentage labels on blends; neutral naming guidance; clarify GMO status | Vegetarian and vegan claims already defined (TCVN 13625:2023, vegetarian allows egg and milk); named ingredients must already be quantified; we found no rule reserving meat or milk words; the GMO label applies only above 5% of ingredients | [@LBL-06; @LBL-15; @LBL-10] | [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]], [[ch14-frontier-demand]], [[app-s9-regulation]] |
| Label instruments | Decree 43/2017 as amended; Circular 29/2023 | Decree 37/2026 and Circular 30/2026/TT-BYT replaced them | [@LBL-07; @LBL-01; @LBL-02] | [[app-s9-regulation]], [[ch07-rules]] |
| Plant milk price position | Priced at or below dairy; no tax condition | An 8% excise (10% from 2028) on drinks above 5 g sugar per 100 ml from 2027, dairy exempt; plant milks' status unresolved | [@FTR-01; @FTR-05] | [[ch13-consumers]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] |
| Children's protein gap | Cheap high-quality protein for children in upland districts; stunting 19.6% (2020) | Stunting 18% of children under five (2023), 32% among ethnic minority children; weighed diets at two upland boarding schools carry enough protein and zinc; shortfalls are calcium and vitamin A, and breakfast is the thin meal (our menu coding) | [@APR-27; @UPL-01; @UPL-18] | [[ch11-protein-diet]] |
| Advice to funders | Fund measurement first; test canteen chay days or chay promotion | Match the route to the funder's unit and rules; only 4 of the original 19 demand moves have a funder whose scope fits and that accepts Vietnam (our coding, `funder_fit.csv`); the chay route has no payer today; animals and CO2e added | [@AFN-05; @AFN-29; @FUF-01] | [[ch18-demand-sizing]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]], [[brief-international]] |
| Advice to startups | Win a first business customer before building a consumer brand | Sell a familiar food with little capital; aim first for ingredient, private-label or co-packing supply; a menu listing for your own analogue brand is not a business customer; the ingredient route is untested | [@AIS-28; @BRD-08] | [[front-exec-summary]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]], [[brief-startups]] |
| Export route | EU and UK private label through Vietnamese co-packers; functional proteins for Japanese and Korean makers | Wrapped foods (USD 128 million of stuffed pasta, 2023) are the base; the European route runs through importers and brand owners supplying retailers that require IFS or BRCGS; the Japan and Korea ingredient route is weakly evidenced; origin rules bind on wrapper flour, not soy | [@XBA-29; @XBA-28; @ORG-01] | [[ch17-export-demand]] |
| Feed export pull (T2) | Export feed standards reward traceable non-soy protein | ASC v1.2, BAP and GLOBALG.A.P. do not require microbial protein, and only BAP counts algae and other aquatic microorganism ingredients toward its marine-ingredient target; the pull is domestic and revealed: about 9,200 t of inactive yeast imported for food and feed, 95% of it at about USD 1.1 per kg | [@FBA-01; @FBA-05; @FBA-06; @FBA-17] | [[ch17-export-demand]], [[app-s6-feed-market]] |
| ASC standard version | Version 1.1 cited as in force | Version 1.2 (v1.1 was never in force) | [@FBA-01] | [[ch17-export-demand]], [[app-d6-export]] |
| Corporate and firm facts | WinCommerce 15,000 stores by 2030 (inferred); no Meat Zero found; Vinh Hoan and Minh Phu as seafood co-investors; no Vietnamese mycoprotein maker | WinCommerce targets 13,000 by 2030; CP Meat Zero listed on a B2B platform but not orderable; Avant began winding up its Singapore unit (January 2026); Emmay reports mycelium foods | [@AIB-12; @AIB-13; @CPC-12; @AIS-34; @AIS-39] | [[ch15-channels]], [[ch14-frontier-demand]], [[ch16-business-buyers]] |
| Hospitals and the army | No retrievable data | A hospital request for quotation accepts 120 g of tofu for 60 g of meat; the army's basic infantry ration is VND 72,000 a day | [@AIB-44; @AIB-45] | [[ch15-channels]] |
| Domestic share of delivered protein | About 19,000 t of domestic or novel protein delivered by 2035 | About 19,000 t through the routes (D-BENCH, `demand_outputs.csv`), of which about 11,000 to 17,000 t made in Vietnam (our calculation; only import substitution applies a domestic share in the model, and the low end applies it to all routes) | [@BUY-02; @BRD-05] | [[ch18-demand-sizing]], [[app-d8-demand-model]] |

## M5.12 Changes made in v0.5

Version 0.5 (September 2026) adds a prologue for newcomers in English and Vietnamese ([[front-prologue]], [[front-prologue-vi]]). No finding changes. The other changes:

| Topic | Version 0.4 | Version 0.5 | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bibliography | `sources/bibliography.md` still listed the 1,726 sources of v0.3; the 577 sources of v0.4 were in `sources.csv` and Appendix R4 but missing from the bibliography | The bibliography lists all 2,384 sources, with the v0.4 and v0.5 rounds at the end | `sources/bibliography.md` |
| Front pages | Cover, how to read, executive summaries, at a glance | The prologue follows the cover; the cover, how to read and both executive summaries link to it; a "newcomers" reading path is added to the site manifest | [[front-cover]], [[front-how-to-read]] |
| Registers | 2,303 sources; 212 glossary terms; 139 key numbers; 54 charts | 2,384 sources (81 from the prologue research, prefixes PRA, PRB and PRC); 223 glossary terms (11 newcomer terms); 143 key numbers; 56 charts | [[app-r4-sources]], [[app-r3-glossary]] |
| Chinese textured protein price in chapter 2 | "About USD 1.6 to 1.7 per kg" for 2023 China-reported exports across three codes, without the 2025 figure | The 2023 figure is kept as dated and the 2025 price (USD 1.24 per kg FOB, about USD 1.29 to 1.38 landed duty-free) is added beside it | [[ch02-alt-protein-today]] |

## M5.13 Changes made in v0.7

Version 0.7 (September 2026) follows a citation check of v0.6. Every citation in the 81 pages, the 143 stat tiles and the 56 charts was read against its source: 7,003 citations to 2,015 of the 2,384 registered sources. 4,384 citations held. 2,619 had an issue: 56 of high severity (a wrong number, date, name or headline claim), 384 of medium severity (an overstatement, or a true fact cited to the wrong source) and 2,179 of low severity (rounding, labels, confidence tags, register hygiene). Every flagged finding and every issue on a front page, brief, tile or chart was checked a second time by a separate reviewer before it was applied.

What v0.7 changes:

- **Corrections applied.** All high- and medium-severity findings (23 of them only in part, where the source needed was unreachable or not yet in the register), and low-severity ones where the fix was exact (a wrong or missing source ID, a confidence tag, a number, date, unit or name set to the source's value). The 384 low-severity findings left unchanged were mostly wording suggestions. Where the evidence for a claim could not be found, the claim now says what the evidence supports, figures from our own registers are labelled as ours, and the gap is an open question. Where a high-severity correction changed a figure or conclusion a reader may have used, a **Correction** box beside it says what v0.6 said.
- **Repeats.** The same corrected fact was carried across the other pages that repeated it (about 300 places), including the executive summaries in both languages, and into about 200 cells of the data files behind the tables and tiles.
- **Register.** The `sources.csv` row for RD-01 is repaired (an unquoted comma had shifted its columns), SCI-16 has its real title and VIS-41 a working DOI link; `bibliography.md` uses version numbers; about 410 source codes written as plain text in Appendix R2 and a few other appendices are now citation links.
- **Open questions.** 70 questions left by the check are added to Appendix R1 (OQ-377 to OQ-446, topic "Citation check, v0.7").

The corrections that matter most:

| Topic | Version 0.6 | Version 0.7 | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fermentation cost shares in the GFI APAC and Hawkwood study | Labour 7% (biomass) and 17% (precision fermentation) of cost; utilities 4 to 5%; 37 to 56% described as capital or depreciation; a conflict between "feedstock at 10% and 18%" and the literature | Labour 5% and 4%; utilities 7% and 17%; depreciation 10% and 18%; feedstock 56% and 37%, the largest line and consistent with the literature. Labour is an even smaller share than v0.6 said [@RGN-01] | kn-labour-share-cost, [[ch03-regional]], [[ch09-economics]], [[app-s3-regional]], [[app-s12-costs]], [[app-f2-drivers-signals]] |

| Funder routes | Humane World described as "the one implementer with Vietnam staff"; animals-spared figures cited to funder pages | The claim is removed (Humane World trained chefs in Viet Nam in 2025; another group has Vietnam staff); animals-spared figures labelled as our calculation | [[ch15-channels]], [[ch18-demand-sizing]], [[ch25-demand-to-frontier]], [[ch29-actor-check]], [[brief-international]] |
| Chay seasonal anecdotes | Hanoi chay sellers "2 to 3 times" at Vu Lan; a Hai Phong caterer's chay trays "-20 to -30%" | The multiplier was a fruit seller's; the fall was one Hanoi restaurant's buying power across all its offering trays, not chay only. Both rows now say so | [[ch12-chay-baseline]], [[app-d1-diet-chay-prices]], kn-vu-lan-uplift |
| Japan feed self-sufficiency | 28% (FY2000), 27% (FY2024) | 26% and 26% (24% provisional FY2025) [@VIS-12] | [[ch22-protein-balance-2050]] |
| UK own-price elasticities (Dogbe and others, 2024) | Nuts -1.18, beans -1.00, peas -0.83 | Nuts -1.51, beans -1.32, peas -1.10 (Table 6) [@GLB-23] | [[app-d7-global-benchmarks]], `price_elasticities.csv` |

| Defatted soy flour tariff line | Listed under 2304.00.21 | Defatted soy flour for human use is 2304.00.10 (0%); 2304.00.21 (2%) is crude soy flour | [[app-s9-regulation]] |
| Decree 43/2026 | "Does not amend Decree 59/2017" | It amends Decrees 65/2010, 69/2010, 59/2017 (genetic resources) and 66/2019 | [[app-s9-regulation]] |
| Cultivated cell density | "Best documented animal-free culture about 28 million cells per mL" cited to Pasitka 2024 | Pasitka 2024 reports up to 130 million cells per mL under perfusion; 28 million is a review figure | [[ch10-technology-fit]], [[app-s13-science]] |
| Hospital meal tender | "1,800 kcal and 60 g of protein a day" | No daily protein figure: 60 g is the minimum of meat or fish per meal (or 120 g of tofu), as v0.6 also said; 1,800 kcal a day applies to the rice diet; the document is a request for quotations | [[ch15-channels]] |
| Partner institutions | SLU brewer's-yeast trials with Can Tho University; an extrusion study "not Vietnamese" | The partner is An Giang University; the extrusion study's first author is also at Can Tho University of Technology | [[app-s7-research]] |
| Other figures | Plant-based analogue premiums "35 to 100%"; world's "first" cultivated beef approval in Singapore; LPG 45 kg cylinder; GE events by crop; solar cost bounds; Mekong Capital ticket size; venture deal count 122 for 2024 | 45 to 77%; Israel approved cultivated beef first; 48 kg cylinder; corrected crop counts; solar bounds and hurdle rates from the source; the unsourced Mekong ticket range removed; 118 deals in 2024 | kn-analogue-price-gap, [[app-s3-regional]], [[app-s12-costs]], [[app-f6-aquafeed-feedstock-futures]], [[app-f3-frontier-tech]], [[app-s11-capital]], [[app-r2-disagreements]] |

Carried to the next version: a short list of internal reconciliations in the data files and registers (for example closing disagreement DG-076, adding the missing firm to the D4 channel rows, and re-deriving two figures) that need a data change rather than a wording change.

**Related:** [[app-r2-disagreements]] (where sources disagree rather than an earlier draft being wrong).
