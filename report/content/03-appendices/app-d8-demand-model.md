summary: "How the model behind the demand-sizing chapter works: seven routes, every assumption with its basis, results for 2025 to 2050, a sensitivity test and conversion into animals spared and CO2e avoided. About 11,000 to 17,000 t of the 19,000 t of protein on the benchmark path in 2035 would be made in Vietnam, and all results are what-if estimates."

# D8. The demand sizing model

**What this appendix contains.** The method, assumptions and full results of the model behind [[ch18-demand-sizing]]. The model is `tools/demand_model.py`, written in Python with the standard library only. It reads two inputs: `data/demand_assumptions.csv`, and the population and meat consumption of S-BASE (the trend scenario) from the Part IV balance model outputs (`data/balance_outputs.csv`). It writes `data/demand_outputs.csv` and `data/demand_sensitivity.csv`. Running `python3 tools/demand_model.py` from the package root reproduces both files exactly.

**Scenarios and routes.** The model has three demand scenarios: D-DRIFT (incumbent drift), D-BENCH (the benchmark path, anchored on what has happened elsewhere) and D-STRETCH (stretch, which needs conditions not yet seen anywhere). It sizes seven routes, R1 to R7 (D8.1). It compares them with S-ALT, the large alternative-protein scenario of the balance model ([[app-f4-balance-model]]).

> **Scenarios, not forecasts.** Every value after 2025 is our estimate from stated assumptions {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}. Most assumptions have no Vietnamese measurement behind them; they are listed with their basis so that anyone can replace them.

## D8.1 Structure and equations

Common inputs, for each year: population P and meat consumption M (kt carcass weight) from S-BASE; meat protein MP = 0.15 x M (the balance model's factor); meat protein per person-day m = MP / P / 365.

| Route | Protein delivered (kt) | Meat protein displaced (kt) |
|---|---|---|
| R1 Ingredient import substitution | Pool x domestic share, where pool = 40 kt of product in 2025 x 0.65 protein x (1 + growth) to the power of years since 2025 | 0 |
| R2 Chay occasions | (chay person-days + added person-days) x upgrade share x 20 g, where chay person-days = P x keepers x days per month / 30.4 x 365 | Added person-days x m x (1 minus compensation); existing chay days are reported separately as meat already avoided |
| R3 Hybrid processed meat | MP x processed share x hybrid adoption x replacement | Delivered x 0.9 |
| R4 Institutional meals | (canteen meals x canteen adoption + school meals x school adoption) x 20 g | Delivered x 0.8 |
| R5 Household modern analogues | Urban population x regular-buyer share x 3 kg x 15% protein | Delivered x 0.2 |
| R6 High-protein plant milks | Plant milk volume x high-protein share x 30 g per litre | 0 |
| R7 Exports | Export tonnes x 25% protein | 0 (not in Vietnam) |

Totals: delivered = sum of routes; displaced = sum of routes; displaced share = displaced / MP. Comparison rows: Part IV S-ALT food protein (1%, 3%, 5% and 10% of meat protein in 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2050) and S-ALT microbial feed protein (kept as context only). Ingredient product for R1 to R4 is delivered protein / 0.60, the protein content of textured-protein line output (50 to 70% as sold, target product profile TPP-01), which is lower than the 0.65 average of the R1 import pool because that pool includes gluten (75%) and isolates (90%); line equivalents = ingredient product / 7 kt a year per 1 t/h line (a line making one tonne an hour). Value = delivered protein x USD 3 per kg (order of magnitude only).

**What "delivered by domestic or novel protein" means.** Only R1 applies an explicit domestic share. R2 to R6 count all plant or novel protein used in those routes, whatever its origin; much of it would be imported soy or pea unless a domestic maker wins the business. R7 counts protein exported. The line equivalents treat all R1 to R4 ingredient product as textured-line output, although much of the R1 pool is gluten and isolates, which need other plants. D8.3 gives the domestic reading and the soy-line count.

**Requirement translation (2030 only).** For each of R2 to R5, the model solves for the level that would displace S-ALT's 2030 volume on its own: hybrid adoption at 30% replacement; share of all canteen and school meal protein; regular buyers; and extra *chay* (vegetarian) days per person per month across the whole population.

Sources for the assumptions are listed in the `source_ids` column of `demand_assumptions.csv`; the main ones are [@BUY-02; @CHY-06; @CHY-09; @FORM-01; @CHN-37; @CHN-39; @CHN-29; @CON-26; @GLB-09; @GLB-11; @GLB-19; @GLB-39; @NOV-37; @NOV-40; @DIE-36].

> **Method note.** The actor check tested the assumptions against new revealed evidence ([[app-m4-actor-check-waves]]). No value in `demand_assumptions.csv` changed and the model outputs are unchanged; the findings below qualify the bases, and D8.3 and D8.5 show their effect.

- **DMA-004 (R1 pool).** Monthly trade shows no *chay* season in the 2024 jump in imports under harmonised system (HS) code 3504, which is priced at less than half China's average for the code. If the post-2023 Chinese increment is not food, food-grade 3504 is about 20% of the 27.0 kt, not 40%, and the pool is about 35 kt of product rather than 40 kt, the lower half of the 30 to 50 kt range [@BRD-05; @BRD-06; @BUY-02] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:inferred}. The part a soy extrusion line can serve was at most 12,832 t in 2025 (HS 2106.10 from China, India and Serbia, all uses) [@TIC-12; @BUY-02] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}.
- **DMA-024 (chay keepers).** No probability survey asks about chay, but the Diet Quality Questionnaire (Gallup, 1,007 adults, 13 November to 12 December 2021) found 7.9% (5.3 to 11.0%) ate no meat, poultry or fish on the previous day. That is a ceiling for chay-day person-days; the central 2.5% uses about a third of it [@APR-36; @BRD-01; @BRD-03] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}.
- **DMA-059 (processed share).** National diet surveillance counts processed-meat days (18.1% of adults on a given day) but its item omits *giò* and *chả* (pork rolls and loaves) and counts days, not grams, so it cannot test R3 [@APR-36; @BRD-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}.
- **DMA-060 to DMA-077 (hybrid adoption and replacement).** Cost does not limit R3: soy extension saves 14 to 16% of raw-material cost at 20% replacement at every annual hog price from 2019 to 2024 (our calculation) [@DIE-25; @TIC-12; @BUY-05] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:inferred}. Adoption is limited by product identity, sensory ceilings (about 10 to 20% of the meat in fine emulsions, 30% in coarse mince, which is the evidence ceiling for DMA-077) and trust: no Vietnamese brand sells a declared blend, and buyers read hidden extension (*độn*, filler) as cheating [@HXE-04; @HXE-09; @TRU-22] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}. D-STRETCH's price-parity condition therefore does not apply to R3; its 15% by 2035 assumes a positive blend frame not yet observed in Vietnam. Processors would mostly extend with imported soy, which enters duty-free, so R3 is plant protein of any origin [@FTR-32].
- **DMA-083 (protein per dish).** Keep 20 g. School caterers' sheets give 85 to 95 g raw meat, 67 to 70 g fish or 80 g tofu per dish, and 31.8 g of protein per lunch including rice (17.5 g animal) at one Hanoi school; factory caterers' main dishes weigh 90 to 120 g [@PMR-22; @PMR-23; @PMR-24; @PMR-26; @UPL-32] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}.
- **DMA-099 to DMA-114 (schools and meal displacement).** Decision 1340's animal-protein target ended in 2020. The Ministry of Health's Decision 3958/QĐ-BYT (25 December 2025) sets no animal share and asks for plant protein (legumes, tofu) at least twice a week; in 48 audited school-weeks only 9 met that rule, the plant slot was filled with tofu beside meat, and no dish used textured soy (our audit, `school_menu_weeks.csv`) [@CHN-33; @AIB-39; @PMR-10; @PMR-26] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}. School protein sold into the plant slot should count as delivered but not displaced (factor 0, like existing chay days); only blends in minced-meat and fish-cake dishes (28.5% of audited days) or added plant days displace meat. The low school adoption values stand.
- **DMA-079 to DMA-098 (canteens).** Five caterers' published menus lead with pork (33.1% of protein dishes), fish (25.6%) and chicken (13.4%), with tofu in 8.7% (plant-only 2.9%) and no textured soy [@UPL-27; @UPL-28; @UPL-29; @UPL-30; @UPL-32] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:stated}. The D-BENCH canteen share implies 36.6 million meal-equivalents a year by 2035, far above what diet-change programmes deliver ([[app-d7-global-benchmarks]]).
- **DMA-168 (export protein share).** Vietnam's textured-protein exports to the EU, the UK, Japan, Korea and Australia were 0 to 73 t each in 2024 to 2025, the Vietnam-made wrapped plant foods found abroad carry 3.6 to 6.2 g of protein per 100 g, and the high-protein dry chay exported today is made from imported isolate, which R7 does not count as domestic protein [@XBA-28; @XBA-26] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}. A share of 0.05 to 0.12 is as defensible as 0.25.

**How much is made in Vietnam, D-BENCH 2035** (our calculation from `demand_outputs.csv`) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}:

| Component, kt of protein | Model reading | Strict reading | Arithmetic |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 import substitution | 11.64 | 10.19 | 11.64 x 35 / 40 (food pool of 35 kt of product, not 40 kt) |
| R2 to R6 (1.60 + 0.79 + 0.81 + 0.43 + 1.29) | 4.91 | 1.23 | 25% of 4.91 (the R1 domestic share applied to protein of any origin) |
| Made in Vietnam for the home market | 16.55 | about 11.4 | sum |
| R7 exports | 2.50 | 0.5 to 1.2 | 10 kt of product x 0.05 to 0.12 protein, not 0.25 |
| All routes | 19.05 | not used | model total |

So the routes create demand for about 19,000 t of protein a year by 2035, of which about 11,000 to 17,000 t would be made in Vietnam for the home market. Within R3, the domestic part at a 25% domestic share is about 0.20 of 0.79 kt. With R7 at 0.05 to 0.12, the model total would be 17.1 to 17.8 kt.

**Soy lines supported.** The model's 3.5 line equivalents in 2035 convert all R1 to R4 ingredient product (24.7 kt) at 7 kt per 1 t/h line. For soy extrusion only, the HS 2106.10 pool from China, India and Serbia (at most 12,832 t of product in 2025, all uses) grows to about 23,000 t by 2035 at 6% a year; a 25% domestic share is about 5,700 t, which is one 1 t/h line or two 0.5 t/h lines. The rest of the R1 pool is gluten and isolates, which need wet-milling or isolate plants (our calculation) [@BUY-02; @TIC-12] {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}.

## D8.4 What S-ALT 2030 would require from each route alone

To displace S-ALT's 2030 volume (11.8 kt of meat protein) on its own {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}:

| Route | Requirement | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| R3 Hybrids | 74% | of all processed meat reformulated with 30% of its meat replaced |
| R4 Institutional meals | 39% | of all protein in canteen and school protein dishes |
| R5 Household analogues | 131 million | regular buyers (Vietnam's population is about 104 million in 2030) |
| R2 Added chay days | 0.43 | extra meat-free days per person per month, whole population, with 30% compensation |

## D8.5 Sensitivity

One assumption at a time set to its low and high bound; all else at D-BENCH values; outcome is total meat protein displaced in 2035 (central value 2.35 kt) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

{{chart:chart-demand-sensitivity}}

| Assumption | Low value | High value | Displaced at low (kt) | Displaced at high (kt) | Largest change (kt) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r2_keeper_share | 0.2 | 0.5 | 2.04 | 2.95 | 0.6 |
| r3_processed_share | 0.03 | 0.08 | 2.06 | 2.77 | 0.42 |
| r2_compensation | 0.0 | 0.6 | 2.73 | 1.96 | 0.39 |
| r4_net_displacement | 0.5 | 1.0 | 2.1 | 2.51 | 0.24 |
| r4_canteen_meals_bn | 0.6 | 1.2 | 2.11 | 2.46 | 0.23 |
| r3_net_displacement | 0.7 | 1.0 | 2.19 | 2.42 | 0.16 |
| r4_protein_per_meal_g | 15.0 | 25.0 | 2.18 | 2.51 | 0.16 |
| r5_net_displacement | 0.0 | 0.5 | 2.26 | 2.47 | 0.13 |
| r5_kg_product_per_buyer | 1.5 | 6.0 | 2.3 | 2.43 | 0.09 |
| r4_school_meals_bn | 0.5 | 1.2 | 2.32 | 2.38 | 0.03 |

No single assumption moves the 2035 D-BENCH result by more than about 0.6 kt, against an S-ALT assumption of 39.3 kt for 2035. The conclusion that the food side of S-ALT is a stretch above every documented route does not depend on any one assumption.

**Corrections outside the model** (D-BENCH 2035; our calculation, not run through `tools/demand_model.py`) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}:

| Correction | Basis | Protein delivered (kt) | Meat protein displaced (kt) |
|---|---|---|---|
| None (model central values) | as published | 19.05 | 2.35 |
| Food pool of 35 kt of product (DMA-004) | monthly trade, D8.2 notes | 17.60 (R1 10.19) | 2.35 |
| Export protein share 0.05 to 0.12 (DMA-168) | wrapped plant foods abroad | 17.1 to 17.8 (R7 0.5 to 1.2) | 2.35 |
| School plant-slot protein not displacing (DMA-114 for schools set to 0) | Decision 3958 and the menu audit | 19.05 | about 2.29 (R4 0.65 to about 0.58) |

None changes the headline: displacement stays at about 0.2% of meat protein, and delivered protein stays in the 17 to 19 kt range.

## D8.6 Limits

- The three most influential inputs are unmeasured in Vietnam: the share of people keeping chay days, the share of meat eaten as processed products and protein per canteen meal ([[ch25-demand-to-frontier]] lists the cheap ways to measure them).
- Displacement factors come from studies outside Vietnam; Vietnamese compensation on added chay days is unknown.
- The model has no prices or elasticities inside it; scenarios encode price conditions through adoption shares. For hybrids, price is not the binding condition (D8.2 notes).
- R2 to R6 count protein of any origin, and only R1 applies a domestic share; D8.3 gives the domestic reading.
- One displacement factor (0.8) covers canteens and schools; school protein sold into the plant slot replaces tofu, not meat (D8.5).
- Funder units (D8.7) are computed outside the model and do not move with the assumptions.
- Feed demand for novel protein is not modelled here. Feed is context only in this study; the balance model ([[app-f4-balance-model]]) covers it.

## D8.7 Funder units: animals spared, CO2e avoided and meals

Welfare, climate and market-shaping funders count animals, meals and tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e, all greenhouse gases expressed as CO2), not tonnes of meat protein. We converted the model's D-BENCH and D-STRETCH outputs for 2030, 2035 and 2050 with a standard-library script (`working-papers/wave7/lines/L3-funder-units/calc_funder_units.py`), which writes `demand_funder_units.csv` and `impact_per_tonne.csv` {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}.

**Method.**
- **Species split.** Added chay days (R2), canteens and schools (R4) and household analogues (R5) take the national consumption mix of the Part IV S-BASE path. Hybrids (R3) take our assumption of 75% pork, 15% poultry and 10% ruminant, informed by the Vissan label audit (pork or pork products first-listed in 49 to 50 of 80 non-chay products, beef in 18; SKU counts, not volumes) [@BUY-05] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Animals.** Displaced protein / 0.15 kg protein per kg carcass = carcass displaced; carcass / FAOSTAT carcass weight per animal for Viet Nam, 2022 to 2024. Counts are slaughter avoided per year, including animals raised abroad for imported meat; they are not welfare-weighted.
- **CO2e.** Gross = carcass displaced x life-cycle intensity from FAO's Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) for East and Southeast Asia, humid zone (reference year 2005). Net = gross minus the replacing protein at 8.36 kg CO2e per kg protein (a pulses proxy). The high bound uses per-protein means from Poore and Nemecek where they exceed GLEAM's upper values.
- **Meals.** A meal-equivalent is one protein dish of 20 g of protein supplied by plant or novel protein instead of meat (DMA-083).
- **Canteen meat mix.** We read five caterers' published menus: of meat-led protein dishes, 62.6% are pork, 26.4% poultry and 11.0% beef. At that mix a tonne of protein through canteens spares about 745 animals (51 pigs, 691 birds, 4 cattle and buffalo) rather than about 1,090 at the national mix [@UPL-27; @UPL-28; @UPL-29; @UPL-30; @UPL-32; @FUF-03] {VN-adjacent|Low} {dx:inferred}. We report the two as a range.

**Conversion factors** [@FUF-03; @FUF-04; @FUF-05; @FUF-07; @FUF-08; @QNT-10]:

| Factor | Value | Range | Unit | Basis | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Results, displacing routes R2 to R5** (our calculation) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}:

| Scenario | Year | Animals spared, million (caterer to national mix) | Chickens and ducks, share | Pigs (national mix) | Net CO2e avoided, kt (range) | Canteen and school meal-equivalents, million | R1 imports replaced, USD million (gross) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-BENCH | 2030 | 0.34 to 0.39 | 91 to 92% | 28,598 | 24 (11 to 47) | 11.0 and 0.0 | 4.8 to 7.0 |
| D-BENCH | 2035 | 2.38 to 2.66 | 93 to 94% | 142,271 | 139 (78 to 250) | 36.6 and 4.0 | 16.1 to 23.3 |
| D-BENCH | 2050 | 5.98 to 6.85 | 93 to 94% | 358,384 | 363 (204 to 652) | 98.4 and 16.0 | 61.8 to 89.3 |
| D-STRETCH | 2030 | 3.18 to 3.36 | 93 to 94% | 196,133 | 188 (109 to 337) | 33.1 and 4.0 | 10.6 to 15.3 |
| D-STRETCH | 2035 | 9.80 to 10.59 | 94% | 557,803 | 553 (326 to 986) | 97.5 and 16.0 | 35.0 to 50.5 |
| D-STRETCH | 2050 | 23.13 to 25.31 | 94% | 1,304,513 | 1,351 (803 to 2,388) | 246.1 and 40.0 | 147.9 to 213.7 |

The national-mix values and their carcass-yield ranges are in `demand_funder_units.csv`; the caterer-mix values replace R4's national-mix animals with 931 animals per tonne of meat protein displaced (745 / 0.8). Precision is arithmetic, not accuracy. Import substitution (R1) spares no animals and avoids about no CO2e, because soy protein replaces soy protein; its value is the import bill. On D-BENCH in 2035, by route: added chay days spare about 1.2 million birds, 49,000 pigs and 56 kt CO2e; hybrids 366,000 birds, 54,000 pigs and 45 kt; canteens and schools 0.60 to 0.89 million animals and 36 kt; household analogues about 116,000 animals and 2 kt.

**Per tonne of protein delivered, 2035** (`impact_per_tonne.csv`; our calculation) {general|Low} {fx:estimate} {dx:inferred}:

| Route (profiles) | What the protein replaces | Meat protein displaced (t) | Pigs | Poultry | Cattle and buffalo | Net t CO2e (soy replacement) | Net t CO2e (fungal replacement) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 import substitution (TPP-01) | Imported textured soy and gluten | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | about 0 | sign unknown |
| R2 upgrades on existing chay days (TPP-02) | Lower-protein chay foods | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | minus 8.4 | minus 11.7 |
| R3 hybrids (TPP-03, TPP-06) | Meat in processed products | 0.9 | 68 | 466 | 3.9 | 56.7 | 53.3 |
| R4 canteens, national dish mix (TPP-04) | Meat in protein dishes | 0.8 | 43 | 1,046 | 2.9 | 44.5 | 41.1 |
| R4 canteens, caterer meat mix | Meat in protein dishes | 0.8 | 51 | 691 | 4 | about 51 | not computed |
| R4 canteens, pork dish | A pork dish | 0.8 | 81 | 0 | 0 | 24.4 | 21.1 |
| R4 canteens, chicken dish | A chicken dish | 0.8 | 0 | 2,760 | 0 | 19.3 | 15.9 |
| R5 household analogues | Mostly nothing | 0.2 | 11 | 261 | 0.7 | 4.8 | 1.5 |
| R6 plant-milk protein (TPP-05) | Nothing measured | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | minus 8.4 | minus 11.7 |

Negative values mean the delivered protein adds emissions because it removes no meat. The R3 CO2e figure rests on the 10% ruminant assumption; at 0% ruminant it would be about 28 t.

**Per meal.** At 20 g of protein and 0.8 net displacement, a canteen meal shifted spares about 0.015 animals at the caterer meat mix (0.010 to 0.029 across five caterers), about 0.020 at the national mix, 0.0016 for a pork dish and 0.055 for a chicken dish, against about 0.134 in Sinergia Animal's own estimate for its programme, as reported by Animal Charity Evaluators [@AFN-26] ([[app-d7-global-benchmarks]]). Upland school lunches and dinners, 84% pork-led among meat-led meals, give about 0.009.

**Limits of the conversion.** Everything inherits the demand model's Low confidence. Species mixes are assumptions; GLEAM intensities refer to 2005 [@FUF-04; @FUF-05] and we found no Vietnamese life-cycle assessment (LCA) per kg of carcass (the one Vietnamese pork LCA reports per pig-month) [@FUF-09]. The package's 0.15 kg protein per kg carcass and its poultry carcass basis could each shift head counts by 15 to 25%. Fish and eggs are not counted, so R2's animal count is a floor; fish leads 26% of canteen protein dishes. Head counts are not welfare-weighted.
