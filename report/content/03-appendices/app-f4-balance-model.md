# F4. The protein and feed balance model

> **Read with care.** The study now concentrates on protein for people. We keep this model because it links the meat people eat to the imported feed behind it: population, meat demand per person, production, feed, and imported soybean meal and maize. Chapter 22 now leads with the human-consumption side ([[ch22-protein-balance-2050]], section 22.1). The model itself is unchanged. Its feed-efficiency and microbial-feed results are context and the record of the earlier feed assessment, not recommendations.

**What this appendix contains.** This is the documentation of the model behind [[ch22-protein-balance-2050]]. It covers:
- purpose and boundary, and the published projections and targets the model uses;
- each calculation step with its parameters, and the four scenarios;
- results by scenario and year;
- the sensitivity test, sanity checks and a reality check against other countries;
- how to rerun and extend the model.

**How to use it.** F4.1 and F4.4 say what the scenarios are. F4.5 holds every result. F4.6 to F4.8 help judge how far to trust them. F4.9 explains how to rerun the model with your own assumptions. Every value for 2030 to 2050 is our estimate (our calculation, `tools/balance_model.py`) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. The 2025 values are calibrated to published data.

> **Method note.** The four scenarios are what-if cases, not forecasts, and carry no probabilities. They are S-BASE (trend), S-HIGH (official growth path), S-EFF (feed efficiency) and S-ALT (alternative protein). Official targets, published projections and our estimates are kept apart and labelled. Record IDs such as BLA-111 point to rows of the data files; they are not citations.

## F4.1 Purpose and boundary

The model answers one supply-side question. Under stated assumptions, how much feed protein, maize and farmland abroad would Vietnam need to 2050? And how much would a feed-efficiency programme or an alternative-protein build-out change that? We built it because no published projection for Vietnam goes beyond 2035 (F4.2.3).

| The model is | The model is not |
|---|---|
| A physical balance: meat, eggs, milk and farmed fish, then compound feed, then protein meals and maize, then imports and land abroad | A market-size forecast: no sales, prices or market values for alternative-protein products |
| Driven by demand as a macro input only: population and per-person consumption from published outlooks, then a stated taper | Consumer research: the S-ALT food shares are illustrative levels, not predictions of uptake |
| Calibrated to 2025 totals: 22 Mt of livestock and poultry feed, 6.5 Mt of aquafeed, 7.2 Mt of SBM fed, 11.91 Mt of maize imported | A price or trade model: it cannot say whether microbial protein will compete ([[ch09-economics]], [[ch21-frontier-technology]]) |
| Transparent: one standard-library Python file and one input file of 238 rows | Probabilistic: the tornado test varies one assumption at a time |

The model scenarios (S-BASE, S-HIGH, S-EFF, S-ALT) are distinct from the 2035 scenarios of [[ch19-outlook-2035]] and the 2050 worlds of [[ch23-scenarios-2050]], which map onto these ranges without new model runs.

## F4.2 Published projections and targets

### F4.2.1 OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2026-2035

This is the only published model we found with Vietnamese meat, feed and protein-meal projections, and it stops at 2035. The report PDF was blocked to our fetch tool, but the data are open through the OECD data interface (SDMX API). All rows: [@QNT-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:projection} (published model, baseline).

| Series (Viet Nam) | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | Growth a year |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pigmeat production, kt cwe | 3,895.6 | 4,241.2 | 4,468.1 | +1.4% |
| Pigmeat food use per person, kg | 28.64 | 31.08 | 31.51 | +1.0% |
| Poultry production, kt | 2,567.1 | 3,434.4 | 4,481.5 | +5.7% |
| Poultry food use per person, kg | 17.03 | 21.23 | 25.80 | +4.2% |
| Beef production, kt cwe | 321.5 | 320.5 | 372.4 | +1.5% |
| Beef food use per person, kg | 3.99 | 4.31 | 4.60 | +1.4% |
| Aquaculture, kt | 5,691.7 | 6,123.4 | 6,826.9 | +1.8% |
| Fish exports, kt live weight | 4,634.9 | 4,387.1 | 5,000.5 | +0.8% |
| Protein-meal feed use, kt | 9,530.4 | 11,058.4 | 12,928.2 | +3.1% |
| Protein-meal imports, kt | 7,370 | 8,597.3 | 10,288.3 | +3.4% |
| Fishmeal feed use, kt | 220.8 | 309.0 | 338.7 | +4.4% |
| Maize imports, kt | 12,000 | 13,965.9 | 16,642.0 | +3.3% |
| Maize feed use, kt | 12,339.6 | 14,334.0 | 16,769.3 | +3.1% |
| Maize production, kt | 4,300 | 4,714.6 | 4,921.8 | +1.4% |

| Milk production, kt | 1,341.1 | 1,648.8 | 2,009.5 | +4.1% |

- **Comparators, 2035.** Pig, poultry and beef food use per person: Viet Nam 61.9 kg, Korea 59.2 kg, China 48.5 kg, Malaysia 46.1 kg [@QNT-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:projection}. The Thai poultry value (3.4 kg) looks implausible and is not used.
- **Caveats.** We read the values through a summarising fetch tool. The annual series are smooth, but one summary swapped two commodity labels, and we reassigned them by magnitude. The poultry base looks like live weight labelled as carcass (F4.9.4).
- **Recipe.** `https://sdmx.oecd.org/public/rest/data/OECD.TAD.ATM,DSD_AGR@DF_OUTLOOK_2026_2035,1.1/VNM.A.<commodity>.<measure>..?startPeriod=2024&endPeriod=2035`. Commodities: CPC_EX_PK (pigmeat), CPC_EX_PT (poultry), CPC_EX_BV (beef), CPC_EX_AC (aquaculture), CPC_04 (fish), CPC_21920 (protein meal), CPC_21233 (fishmeal), CPC_0112 (maize), CPC_0141 (soybean), CPC_0221 (milk). Measures: QP (production), QC (consumption), IM (imports), EX (exports), FE (feed), CR (crush), FO_PC (food per person), YLD (yield), joined with "+". Replace VNM with KOR, CHN, ARG, BRA or USA for comparators and origin yields, and the dataflow name for a new edition.

| UN WPP 2024, medium variant | 101.6 M (2025), 104.25 M (2030), 106.53 M (2035), 108.44 M (2040), 110.01 M (2050) | [@GT-12] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} |
| Decision 1520/QD-TTg (livestock strategy), 2030 | Industrial feed 30 to 32 Mt; meat 6.0 to 6.5 Mt cwe; 58 to 62 kg of meat and 220 to 225 eggs per person | [@MAC-23; @REG-54] {VN-direct\|High} {fx:projection} (official target) |

| IFPRI IMPACT, SSP2 | Global per-person demand for protein from red meat, poultry, dairy and eggs +14% from 2020 to 2050; South Asia +49% | [@QNT-12] {general\|High} {fx:projection} |
| Falcon, Naylor and Shankar | Global food demand +50 to 60% from 2019 to 2050; poultry the dominant meat | [@QNT-05] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} |

Vietnamese household-demand studies find rising meat budget shares and a shift to poultry and beef, but we extracted no projected numbers [@QNT-03; @QNT-04] {VN-direct|Medium}. All 86 rows are in `balance_published_projections.csv`.

### F4.2.3 What we did not find

We found no FAO, IFPRI, GLOBIOM (a global land-use model) or peer-reviewed projection of Vietnamese meat, feed or feed protein to 2050 [@QNT-01; @QNT-02; @QNT-15] {VN-direct|Medium}. OECD-FAO stops at 2035. We could not read USDA's country tables to 2035. Official volume targets stop at 2030 [@MAC-23; @NTS-23] {VN-direct|High}. Our 2040 and 2050 values are extensions.

## F4.3 Model structure, step by step

Seven steps run for each scenario and year: demand, production, compound feed, protein meals and maize, land abroad, S-ALT substitution, emissions.

**Parameter lookup.** Each row of `balance_assumptions.csv` has a parameter, a scenario tag (ALL, S-BASE, S-HIGH, S-EFF, S-ALT, SENS-LOW, SENS-HIGH) and a year (or ALL). The script tries the sensitivity override first, then the scenario, then S-BASE, then ALL. Between listed years it interpolates linearly. Reported years: 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2050.

### F4.3.1 Step 1: demand (macro input)

2025 consumption per person (kg cwe) = 2025 live-weight output x dressing yield / SSR / population.

| Parameter | Pork | Poultry | Beef and buffalo | Source and tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 output, kt live weight | 5,389.2 | 2,601.9 | 624.3 | [@MAC-14; @MAC-12] {VN-direct\|High} |
| Dressing yield | 0.723 | 0.70 | 0.515 | Our calibration: pork and beef set so the carcass base equals OECD-FAO's [@QNT-01]; poultry our assumption {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| SSR (2025, held constant) | 0.961 | 0.875 | 0.522 | OECD-FAO production / consumption [@QNT-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| 2025 demand, kg cwe per person | 39.9 | 20.5 | 6.1 (total 66.5) | Our calculation {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| S-BASE index 2030 / 2035 / 2050 | 1.085 / 1.100 / 1.134 | 1.247 / 1.515 / 1.674 | 1.079 / 1.152 / 1.337 | OECD-FAO to 2035 [@QNT-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection}; then our taper {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |

After 2035 the taper is +0.2% a year for pork, +1.0% (to 2040) then +0.5% for poultry, and +1.0% for beef. Other inputs:
- **Population:** UN WPP medium variant in every scenario and year, including 2025, so growth rates never mix UN and GSO series [@GT-12] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Eggs:** 210.6 per person in 2025 (21.4 billion eggs [@MAC-14] divided by UN WPP population [@GT-12]), rising to 235 (2030) and 275 (2050); egg weight 0.055 kg; the path and egg weight are our assumptions; no published projection found {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Milk:** 1,300 kt in 2025 (NSO [@MAC-14]; OECD-FAO gives 1,341 kt), OECD-FAO growth to 2035 [@QNT-01], then +3% and +2% a year to 2050 (our taper) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **S-HIGH income multiplier:** (GDP ratio of S-HIGH to S-BASE) raised to an elasticity falling from 0.30 to 0.20 (our assumption); S-HIGH GDP from Decision 768 [@GT-11], S-BASE GDP from USDA [@QNT-02]; 1.06 (2030), 1.11 (2040), 1.15 (2050) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F4.3.2 Step 2: production

Meat (cwe) = demand per person x population x (1 minus the S-ALT food share) x SSR; live weight = cwe / dressing yield. Aquaculture = 2025 NSO output by group x an index. 2025 output in kt, with our fixed export share in brackets: pangasius 1,938.8 (0.90), whiteleg shrimp 994.4 (0.75), other shrimp and crustaceans 387.3 (0.60), other fed fish such as tilapia, snakehead, carps and marine fish 2,096.2 (0.10), and unfed molluscs, seaweed and others 700.1 (0.30); total 6,116.8 kt [@MAC-15] {VN-direct|High}. Exports come to 3.14 Mt (51%), consistent with OECD-FAO fish exports of 4.63 Mt, which also include capture [@QNT-01] {VN-direct|Low}.

The S-BASE aquaculture index is 1.076 (2030), 1.200 (2035) and 1.393 (2050): OECD-FAO growth to 2035 [@QNT-01], then +1% a year (our assumption) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. S-HIGH follows the 7.0 Mt target for 2030 [@QNT-06], then +1.5% and +1.0% a year {fx:estimate}.

**Appendix F6 paths.** AQ-BASE in [[app-f6-aquafeed-feedstock-futures]] reuses the S-BASE index but lets marine finfish grow faster, reaching 8.86 Mt in 2050 against 8.52 Mt here (aquafeed 9.7 against 9.2 Mt). AQ-LOW (7.42 Mt) matches the low aquaculture sensitivity; AQ-HIGH (11.27 Mt) lies above S-HIGH (8.97 Mt). Because aquaculture growth after 2035 moves 2050 SBM need by only about 1 Mt (F4.6), the national result is unchanged {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F4.3.3 Step 3: compound feed by species group

Feed = output x FCR x compound-feed share x (1 minus the annual FCR gain) raised to the years since 2025. One scale factor sets 2025 aquafeed to the chosen base. All rows {VN-direct|Low}; paths {fx:estimate}.

| Group | FCR | Compound share, 2025 | Path to 2050 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pigs | 2.8, whole herd (range 2.6 to 3.2) | 0.81, calibrated: 12.17 Mt (55.3% of 22 Mt; 2024 share applied to 2025) / (5.39 Mt x 2.8) | 0.88 (2030), 0.94 (2040), 0.97 (2050) | [@MAC-28; @MAC-01; @MAC-12] |
| Poultry | Meat 2.5 (broilers about 1.7, native birds and ducks 2.5 to 3.2); eggs 2.4 | 0.96, calibrated to 9.0 Mt (40.9%, the 2024 share, of 22 Mt in 2025) | 0.97 to 0.98 (our assumption) | [@MAC-28; @MAC-01]; FCRs our assumption |
| Other livestock | 0.42 t of feed per t of (beef and buffalo live weight plus milk), our calibration to 0.81 Mt (3.7% of 22 Mt) | n/a | scales with output | [@MAC-28; @MAC-01] |
| Pangasius; whiteleg shrimp | 1.5; 1.3 | 1.00 | constant | Our assumption; feed volumes and intensive whiteleg farming [@MAC-06] |
| Other shrimp; other fish | 1.5; 1.5 | 0.30; 0.68 | 0.50; index 1.25 by 2050 | Our assumption |
| Aquafeed scale factor | 1.00 with USDA's 6.5 Mt; 0.67 with the industry midpoint of 4.35 Mt | | | [@MAC-01; @MAC-06] |
| FCR gain a year | S-BASE 0.4% (livestock), 0.3% (aquaculture); S-EFF 1.0% and 0.8% | | | Our assumption |

### F4.3.4 Step 4: protein meals and maize

| Quantity | Equation and values | Source and tags |
|---|---|---|
| SBM demand | Feed x inclusion (pigs 18%, poultry 28%, other livestock 8%, pangasius and whiteleg 28%, other shrimp and fish 25%) x calibration 1.10 (reproduces 7.2 Mt in 2025) x (1 + inclusion trend) to the power of years. Implied 2025 average: 253 kg per t of feed | [@MAC-04] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Other protein meals | 2.43 Mt SBM-equivalent in 2025 (other oilseed meals 2.33 Mt at about 30% CP, our calculation: OECD-FAO protein-meal feed use 9.53 Mt minus 7.2 Mt of SBM fed; plus DDGS 1.55 Mt at 27% CP; converted at 46% CP); scales with feed | [@QNT-01; @FS-23; @MAC-04] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Fishmeal | Feed x inclusion (whiteleg 12%, other shrimp 8%, other fish 2.5%, pangasius 1%, pigs and poultry 0.05%; the 8%, 2.5% and 0.05% rates are our assumptions) x trend (minus 1.5% a year; minus 3% in S-EFF). 262 kt in 2025 (our calculation) | [@FM-05; @FM-08] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Protein-meal demand | SBM + other meals + fishmeal x 0.65 / 0.46 (fishmeal at 65% CP; SBM at 46% CP, our convention) | [@FM-02] {general\|Medium} |
| SBM import need | Equal to SBM demand; domestic soybeans (42 to 43 kt) go mostly to food (our assumption; error under 0.5%). Beans = SBM / 0.78 | [@MAC-04] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Maize | Compound-feed maize = feed x inclusion (pigs 45%, poultry 52%, other livestock 30%, aquafeed 5%; our assumptions), calibrated to 10.9 Mt. Non-compound maize (3.5 Mt, feed and residual 14.4 Mt minus 10.9 Mt) shrinks with non-compound pig feeding; non-feed use (1.61 Mt, a balancing figure) and domestic output (4.1 Mt) are constant. Imports = use minus output (11.91 Mt in 2025) | [@FS-23; @MAC-01; @MAC-08] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

### F4.3.5 Step 5: land abroad

Soybean land = SBM x 0.80 (mass allocation, our assumption; economic about 0.65, gross 1.0) / (bean yield x 0.78). Bean yield 3.16 t per ha in 2025 (OECD-FAO yields for Argentina 2.91, Brazil 3.62 and the United States 3.56, weighted by origin), +0.6% a year. Maize land = imports / 7.28 t per ha (Argentina 7.69, Brazil 6.11, United States 11.68 and others 6.5, weighted by 2025 import origin: Argentina 46.5% and Brazil 34.8%; the split of the other 18.7% into 13% United States and 5.7% others is our assumption), +0.3% a year [@QNT-01; @MAC-08; @MAC-09] {general|Medium} {fx:projection}. Worked 2025 example: 7.2 x 0.80 / (3.16 x 0.78) = 2.34 M ha of soy plus 11.91 / 7.28 = 1.64 M ha of maize, 3.97 M ha in total, about five times Vietnam's maize area of 0.81 M ha (our calculation) {VN-direct|Low}.

### F4.3.6 Steps 6 and 7: S-ALT substitution and emissions

- **Food route.** A share of meat demand (at 0.15 kg of protein per kg cwe) is replaced; meat production and its feed fall in proportion. Part of the substitute is fermented (mycoprotein-type, on sugar); the rest is plant-based from imported soy.
- **Feed route.** Shares of SBM protein and fishmeal protein are replaced one for one, on crude protein, by microbial protein, partly from hydrogen gas fermentation and partly from sugar or starch.
- **Emissions.** Electricity x a grid factor derived from PDP8 targets: 0.659 t CO2 per MWh (2023 official), 0.38 (2030), 0.29 (2035), 0.20 (2040), 0.021 (2050) [@COST-08; @GT-11] {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:estimate}. It assumes PDP8 is delivered. Avoided emissions use published averages: 0.85 kg CO2e per kg of SBM protein and 2.72 kg per kg of fishmeal protein [@QNT-11] {general|Low}. Cassava farming, steam, urea and land-use change are excluded.

| Conversion factor | Value | Source and tags |
|---|---|---|
| Sugar route inputs | 4.0 t of glucose (range 3.0 to 4.4) and 0.37 t of urea per t of protein; 3.5 kWh per kg of protein. Our derivation from cost stack A in [[app-s12-costs]] (2.0 to 2.2 t of glucose and 0.17 to 0.20 t of urea per t of product at 45 to 55% protein) | Glucose method [@COST-43]; urea and electricity prices used to convert cost lines [@COST-30; @COST-01] {general\|Low} |
| Cassava | 1.08 t of glucose per t of starch (stoichiometry, our assumption); 4.4 t of fresh roots per t of starch [@FS-05]; 20.5 t of roots per ha (derived: 10.24 Mt from about 499,100 ha [@FS-01]). Sugar: 0.95 t per t of glucose (stoichiometry, our assumption) | [@FS-05; @FS-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Gas route | 41 kWh per kg of protein (25 kWh per kg of dry biomass [@QNT-10] plus about 2 kWh processing, divided by our 65% protein; Sillman and others assume 60%; range 17 to 55); 2.7 kg CO2 (1.76 kg per kg of biomass [@QNT-10]) and 0.17 kg NH3 (0.112 kg per kg of biomass [@QNT-09]) per kg of protein; 0.72 kg H2 per kg of protein (our calculation: 25 kWh per kg of biomass at 53 kWh per kg of H2, divided by 0.65; the published gas-route model gives 0.69 t per t of protein [@FTG-01]) | Our derivation from [@QNT-10; @QNT-09; @FTG-01] {general\|Low} |
| Product protein | Sugar-route feed 55%; gas-route feed 65% (within the 55 to 75% usable protein range for single-cell protein); fermented food ingredient 45%; plant ingredient 55%; finished food 15%. Plant-based food needs 3.3 t of beans per t of protein (beans at 36% protein, about 84% recovered: 1 / (0.36 x 0.84)) | Our assumptions; single-cell protein range [@QNT-09] {general\|Low} |

## F4.4 Scenario definitions

All values are our assumptions for the years shown {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

| Parameter | S-BASE (trend) | S-HIGH (official growth) | S-EFF (efficiency) | S-ALT (alternative protein) | Records |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meat demand per person, kg cwe | 75.4 (2030), 87.6 (2050) | x income multiplier: 80.0 (2030), 101.0 (2050) | As S-BASE | As S-BASE before substitution | BLA-048 to BLA-104 |
| GDP path behind demand | 5.7% a year to 2035 (USDA), then 4.5% | 10% (2026 to 2030), then 7.5% (PDP8) | As S-BASE | As S-BASE | BLA-100 |
| Aquaculture, Mt | 6.58 (2030), 8.52 (2050) | 7.00 (2030), 8.97 (2050) | As S-BASE | As S-BASE | BLA-073 to BLA-081 |
| FCR gain a year, livestock / aquaculture | 0.4% / 0.3% | As S-BASE | 1.0% / 0.8% | As S-BASE | BLA-143 to BLA-146 |
| SBM inclusion trend | 0 | 0 | Minus 1% a year | 0 | BLA-158, BLA-159 |
| Other meals trend | 0 | 0 | Plus 0.5% a year | 0 | BLA-162, BLA-163 |
| Fishmeal inclusion trend | Minus 1.5% a year | Minus 1.5% | Minus 3% | Minus 1.5% | BLA-171, BLA-172 |
| Microbial share of SBM protein | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1% (2030), 3% (2035), 5% (2040), 10% (2050) | BLA-190 to BLA-196 |
| Microbial share of fishmeal protein | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10%, 18%, 25%, 40% | BLA-197 to BLA-201 |
| Meat demand replaced | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1%, 3%, 5%, 10% | BLA-202 to BLA-206 |
| Gas-route share of microbial feed protein | n/a | n/a | n/a | 0%, 10%, 30%, 50% | BLA-207 to BLA-210 |
| Fermented share of the food substitute | n/a | n/a | n/a | 30%, 35%, 40%, 50% | BLA-211 to BLA-214 |

Shared by all: population, SSR, dressing yields, export shares, compound shares, domestic maize output (4.1 Mt), non-feed maize (1.61 Mt) and yields abroad.
- **S-ALT shares are what-if levels, not targets.** The 40% fishmeal share by 2050 sits within trials that replaced 25 to 60% of fishmeal without growth loss ([[app-s6-feed-market]], section S6.9) [@FM-08; @FM-17; @FM-22] {general|Medium}. The 10% SBM share by 2050 implies large cost falls or policy support: at 2026 costs microbial feed protein costs 4.6 to 5.1 times SBM protein (our calculation in [[ch09-economics]] and [[app-s6-feed-market]], from the fungal feed-protein cost stack and the World Bank soybean-meal price [@FM-01]) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **S-HIGH is a stress case,** not a central view.
- **A combined S-EFF plus S-ALT case was not modelled,** so we give no number for it. The two act through different channels and add up.

## F4.5 Results by scenario and year

All tables: our calculation, `tools/balance_model.py`, from `balance_outputs.csv`. Values for 2030 to 2050 are {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}; 2025 is the calibrated base, identical in all scenarios.

### F4.5.1 Compound feed

**Compound feed, Mt: total (livestock and poultry / aquafeed)**

| Scenario | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 | 2050 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-BASE | 28.5 (22.0 / 6.5) | 33.5 (26.4 / 7.1) | 37.2 (29.3 / 7.9) | 39.1 (30.7 / 8.4) | 40.9 (31.6 / 9.2) |
| S-HIGH | 28.5 | 35.6 (28.1 / 7.5) | 39.8 (31.6 / 8.2) | 43.0 (34.1 / 8.9) | 46.2 (36.5 / 9.7) |
| S-EFF | 28.5 | 32.5 (25.6 / 6.9) | 35.1 (27.5 / 7.5) | 35.8 (28.0 / 7.8) | 35.4 (27.2 / 8.1) |
| S-ALT | 28.5 | 33.3 (26.2 / 7.1) | 36.4 (28.5 / 7.9) | 37.8 (29.4 / 8.4) | 38.2 (28.9 / 9.2) |

S-BASE by group, 2025 and 2050, Mt: pigs 12.17 and 16.26; poultry 9.00 and 13.99; other livestock 0.81 and 1.40; pangasius 2.90 and 3.75; whiteleg shrimp 1.29 and 1.67; other shrimp 0.17 and 0.37; other fish 2.13 and 3.45. Aquafeed stays at 21 to 24% of compound feed throughout. S-EFF feed peaks around 2040.

### F4.5.2 Soybean meal

**SBM import need, Mt (as meal, or as beans crushed in Vietnam)**

| Scenario | 2025 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 | 2050 | 2050 against 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-BASE | 7.20 | 8.46 | 9.47 | 9.95 | 10.40 | +44% |
| S-HIGH | 7.20 | 8.98 | 10.11 | 10.92 | 11.72 | +63% |
| S-EFF | 7.20 | 7.81 | 8.08 | 7.85 | 7.00 | minus 3% |
| S-ALT | 7.20 | 8.32 | 9.01 | 9.15 | 8.78 | +22% |

{{chart:chart-sbm-scenarios-2050}}

**Beans, intensity and total protein meals**

| Scenario | Bean equivalent, Mt: 2030 / 2050 | SBM per t of feed, kg: 2030 / 2050 | Protein meals, Mt SBM-equivalent: 2030 / 2050 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 base | 9.2 | 253 | 10.0 |
| S-BASE | 10.8 / 13.3 | 252 / 254 | 11.7 / 14.2 |
| S-HIGH | 11.5 / 15.0 | 252 / 254 | 12.4 / 16.0 |
| S-EFF | 10.0 / 9.0 | 240 / 198 | 11.0 / 10.6 |
| S-ALT | 10.7 / 11.3 | 250 / 230 | 11.5 / 12.3 |

{{kn:kn-sbm-need-2050}} {{kn:kn-sbm-range-2050}}

**Efficiency against alternative protein.** In 2050 S-EFF needs 3.40 Mt less SBM than S-BASE (minus 33%) and S-ALT 1.62 Mt less (minus 16%): efficiency does about twice the work at the shares tested {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Feed efficiency is a lever for feed mills and farms; it sits outside this study, which concentrates on protein for people.

{{kn:kn-efficiency-vs-alt}}

### F4.5.3 Maize, fishmeal and land abroad

| Scenario | Maize import need, Mt: 2030 / 2035 / 2040 / 2050 | Fishmeal, kt: 2030 / 2035 / 2040 / 2050 | Land abroad (soy plus maize), M ha: 2030 / 2035 / 2040 / 2050 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 base | 11.91 | 262 | 3.97 (2.34 + 1.64) |
| S-BASE | 12.96 / 13.85 / 13.98 / 13.84 | 265 / 274 / 269 / 253 | 4.42 / 4.74 / 4.79 / 4.67 (2050: 2.91 + 1.76) |
| S-HIGH | 13.91 / 15.16 / 15.80 / 16.28 | 281 / 283 / 284 / 267 | 4.71 / 5.11 / 5.32 / 5.35 |
| S-EFF | 12.50 / 12.90 / 12.56 / 11.56 | 239 / 224 / 198 / 152 | 4.15 / 4.19 / 3.98 / 3.43 |
| S-ALT | 12.83 / 13.43 / 13.28 / 12.47 | 238 / 225 / 201 / 151 | 4.36 / 4.55 / 4.46 / 4.04 |

- **Maize grows more slowly than SBM** (+16% against +44% by 2050 in S-BASE) because non-compound maize feeding shrinks as pig farming industrialises and non-feed use is held flat; total S-BASE maize use goes from 16.0 Mt (2025) to 17.9 Mt (2050) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Fishmeal:** S-EFF and S-ALT reach about 151 kt by 2050 through different levers, faster inclusion cuts and 40% microbial replacement {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Land abroad** peaks around 2040 in S-BASE because yields abroad keep rising while needs flatten; the S-ALT figure for 2050 excludes 52,000 ha for soy used in plant-based food {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

{{kn:kn-land-abroad-feed}}

### F4.5.4 Meat, demand per person and other outputs

| Scenario | Meat production, Mt cwe: 2030 / 2035 / 2040 / 2050 | Meat demand per person, kg cwe: 2030 / 2035 / 2040 / 2050 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025 base | 6.04 (59.4 kg per person) | 66.5 (pork 39.9, poultry 20.5, beef and buffalo 6.1) |
| S-BASE and S-EFF | 7.02 / 7.78 / 8.13 / 8.55 | 75.4 / 81.9 / 84.3 / 87.6 (2050: 45.2, 34.3, 8.1) |
| S-HIGH | 7.46 / 8.41 / 9.05 / 9.85 | 80.0 / 88.6 / 93.8 / 101.0 (2050: 52.1, 39.5, 9.3) |
| S-ALT | 6.95 / 7.54 / 7.73 / 7.69 | As S-BASE before substitution; animal meat 74.7 / 79.5 / 80.1 / 78.9 |

Other S-BASE outputs: eggs 235 per person (2030) and 275 (2050); milk 2.75 Mt (2050); aquaculture 6.58 Mt (2030) and 8.52 Mt (2050), 51% exported {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F4.5.5 What S-ALT implies

| Item | 2030 | 2040 | 2050 | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Microbial feed protein | 56 | 265 | 514 | kt protein |

| Share of high-protein feed protein | 1.0 | 4.4 | 8.4 | % |
| Microbial feed product (dry) | 102 | 460 | 863 | kt |
| Multiples of Entobel's Vietnamese design capacity (11 kt a year across its 1 kt and 10 kt plants) | 9 | 42 | 78 | multiples |
| Plants of 20 kt a year (Calysseo, China) | 5 | 23 | 43 | plants |
| Food substitute protein | 12 | 69 | 145 | kt protein |
| Food protein ingredient (dry); finished product (15% protein) | 23; 79 | 136; 457 | 292; 964 | kt |
| Glucose, sugar route (feed plus food) | 238 | 852 | 1,318 | kt |

| Urea (sugar route) | 22 | 79 | 122 | kt |
| Electricity | 0.21 | 4.0 | 11.7 | TWh a year |
| Hydrogen; CO2 as feedstock (gas route) | 0; 0 | 57; 215 | 185; 694 | kt a year |
| Soybeans for plant-based food (imported) | 27 | 136 | 239 | kt |
| SBM imports avoided against S-BASE | 0.14 | 0.80 | 1.62 | Mt |
| via microbial feed protein; via less meat | 0.08; 0.05 | 0.48; 0.32 | 0.98; 0.65 | Mt |
| Fishmeal avoided | 27 | 68 | 102 | kt |
| Maize imports avoided | 0.13 | 0.70 | 1.37 | Mt |
| Soy land abroad avoided, net of food soy | 37 | 205 | 402 | thousand ha |

| Net electricity balance | minus 0.02 | plus 0.37 | minus 0.57 | Mt CO2 |

The 2035 column is in `balance_outputs.csv` (our calculation; for example 160 kt of microbial feed protein, 2.7% of high-protein feed protein). The share is microbial protein divided by microbial protein plus protein-meal demand x 0.46. Plant equivalents are our arithmetic from the design sizes of Entobel's insect-meal plant in Vietnam (a size benchmark only) and Calysseo's FeedKind plant in China, which halted in 2026 [@ECO-01; @ECO-03; @FM-13; @COST-55; @FTG-06] {VN-direct|Low}.

{{kn:kn-salt-plants-2050}}

**Readings.** All {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate} unless tagged otherwise. Most of the S-ALT build-out is microbial feed protein, which is now context; the food route is the part that bears on protein for people.
- **The food route saves the most imports per tonne.** On the 2050 S-BASE feed structure, replacing 1 t of meat protein avoids about 4.5 t of SBM and 9.5 t of maize imports, against about 1.65 t of imported soybeans when half the substitute is plant-based. Microbial feed protein replaces SBM but not maize. Diet change is outside our scope; this is arithmetic only.
- **Carbohydrate is the binding physical constraint.** The 2050 need of 5.37 Mt of fresh cassava roots is 52% of the 2025 harvest (10.24 Mt) and of the cassava area; the sugar alternative, 1.25 Mt, is about 96% of the 2025/26 crop [@FS-01; @FS-31]. Roots rose about 50 to 90% in price, depending on province, in the year to April 2026 and now also feed E10 ethanol [@FS-11; @GT-10] {VN-direct|Medium}. The food part of S-ALT needs only about 22% of the glucose (our calculation in [[ch21-frontier-technology]], section 21.5).
- **Energy volume is not the constraint; energy carbon is.** The 11.7 TWh of 2050 is 0.85 to 0.94% of planned commercial electricity [@GT-11]; 185 kt of hydrogen is 0.9 to 1.9% of the official target of 10 to 20 Mt of clean hydrogen a year by 2050 [@NTS-25].
- **Carbon break-even.** At 41 kWh per kg of protein, gas-route protein beats SBM only below about 21 g CO2 per kWh (0.85 / 41) and fishmeal below about 66 g. The sugar route's electricity (3.5 kWh per kg) beats SBM below about 240 g. The PDP8-derived grid passes 240 g in the late 2030s and reaches about 21 g only around 2050, so before then the gas route needs dedicated renewable power. The break-even depends on the energy factor (F4.9.4).
- **Land.** Cassava-based microbial protein needs about 0.80 ha per t of protein (4.0 x 0.926 x 4.4 / 20.5), against about 0.71 ha for imported SBM: it moves land rather than saving it. Hydrogen gas fermentation needs 0.4% of SBM's land per t of protein in one study [@QNT-11] {general|Medium}.

## F4.6 Sensitivity: what moves the 2050 result

One assumption, or a paired set, is varied with all else at S-BASE (10.40 Mt of SBM and 13.84 Mt of maize imports in 2050). The last row varies S-ALT. Source: `balance_sensitivity.csv`; all rows {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}, horizon 2050.

| Rank | Assumption varied (low; high) | SBM, low / high, Mt | SBM swing | Maize imports, low / high, Mt | Maize swing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SBM inclusion trend (minus 1.0; plus 0.5% a year) | 8.09 / 11.78 | 3.69 | 13.84 / 13.84 | 0 |
| 2 | FCR gain rate, livestock and aquaculture (0 and 0; 1.0 and 0.8% a year) | 11.42 / 9.00 | 2.42 | 15.55 / 11.56 | 3.99 |
| 3 | Aquaculture growth after 2035 (0; 2.5% a year) | 10.02 / 11.08 | 1.05 | 13.78 / 13.96 | 0.18 |
| 4 | Poultry demand per person after 2030 (index 1.45; 1.99 in 2050) | 9.97 / 11.01 | 1.05 | 13.09 / 14.88 | 1.79 |
| 5 | Meat self-sufficiency, pork and poultry (10 points lower; 1.00 and 0.915 by 2050) | 9.70 / 10.68 | 0.98 | 12.37 / 14.42 | 2.05 |
| 6 | Population 2050 (minus 5%; plus 5%, illustrative) | 10.02 / 10.78 | 0.76 | 13.06 / 14.62 | 1.55 |
| 7 | Pig whole-herd FCR, which sets the 2025 compound share (2.6; 3.2) | 10.17 / 10.86 | 0.69 | 13.59 / 14.70 | 1.10 |
| 8 | Pork demand per person after 2035 (minus 10%; plus 10% in 2050) | 10.08 / 10.73 | 0.65 | 13.04 / 14.64 | 1.61 |
| 9 | Pig compound-feed share by 2050 (0.90; 1.00) | 10.17 / 10.50 | 0.33 | 14.71 / 13.47 | 1.24 |
| 10 | 2025 aquafeed volume (industry 4.35 Mt; USDA 6.5 Mt) | 10.43 / 10.40 | 0.02 | 13.84 / 13.84 | 0.00 |
| 11 | Domestic maize output (minus 2%; plus 1.4% a year) | 10.40 / 10.40 | 0 | 15.47 / 12.14 | 3.33 |
| 12 | Non-feed maize, E10 stress test (1.61 Mt; 4.4 Mt by 2050) | 10.40 / 10.40 | 0 | 13.84 / 16.63 | 2.79 |
| Comparison | S-ALT microbial share of SBM protein (0%; 20% by 2050) | 9.75 / 7.80 | 1.95 | 12.47 / 12.47 | 0 |

{{chart:chart-sbm-tornado}}

**Readings.**
- **Formulation and efficiency dominate.** Each 1% a year fall in national SBM inclusion is worth about 2.3 Mt of imports in 2050 (10.40 minus 8.09) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Yet we found no Vietnamese series of SBM inclusion or FCR by species {VN-direct|High}. A national protein balance could carry them in its memo line on the feed behind domestic meat ([[ch28-robust-moves]], RM-01).
- **Demand assumptions matter less:** about 0.6 to 1 Mt each in 2050 {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Maize responds to other levers:** FCR (4.0 Mt), domestic output (3.3 Mt) and non-feed use (2.8 Mt) in 2050. Pig industrialisation raises SBM but lowers maize, because the non-compound maize ration shrinks {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **The unresolved 2025 aquafeed volume hardly matters** (0.02 Mt in 2050), because SBM is calibrated on the 7.2 Mt actually fed. Doubling S-ALT's microbial share cuts 2050 need by another 1 Mt, less than the inclusion trend {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- The ranges are illustrative, not confidence intervals; interactions are not tested.

Vietnam becomes an "aged society" by 2035, which argues for slower per-person growth [@GT-13] {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:projection}.

### F4.7.2 The 2030 feed target: resolution of OQ-127

> **Correction.** An earlier draft left open whether the 2030 target of 30 to 32 Mt of industrial feed includes aquafeed (OQ-127, [[ch30-unknowns]], [[app-r1-open-questions]]), and [[app-f1-outlook]] (F1.3) noted that on an all-feed reading the target was already close. The feed-industry scheme, Decision 1625/QD-TTg of 15 December 2023, which the earlier draft did not cite, sets 24 to 25 Mt of industrial livestock feed for 2025 and 30 to 32 Mt for 2030. It refers to *thức ăn chăn nuôi* (livestock feed), so the 2030 target appears to cover livestock and poultry feed only [@NTS-23] {VN-direct|Medium}. This supersedes the all-feed reading and our first model notes, which judged the 2030 value plausible "if the target includes aquafeed". Confidence is Medium: one reading of the text, not confirmed by MAE.

| Item | Value | Source and tags |
|---|---|---|
| Livestock and poultry feed, 2024; 2025 | 21.5 Mt; about 22 Mt, against a 2025 target of 24 to 25 Mt (probably missed; USDA's estimate) | [@MAC-28; @MAC-01; @NTS-23] {VN-direct\|High} |
| First half of 2026 | 12.43 Mt, +7.5% | [@MAC-03] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Growth needed, 2025 to 2030 | 6.4 to 7.8% a year, about twice the 2024 and 2025 pace | Our calculation ([[app-f1-outlook]]) {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| S-BASE, 2030 | 26.4 Mt (3.8% a year): 3.6 to 5.6 Mt short | Our calculation {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| S-HIGH, 2030 | 28.1 Mt (5.0% a year): 1.9 to 3.9 Mt short | Our calculation {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Arithmetic check | 22 Mt growing 7.5% every year gives 31.6 Mt in 2030 | Our calculation, not a projection {VN-direct\|Low} |

On the livestock-only reading, the 2030 target looks out of reach on both our trend and official-growth paths {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. It would be met only if the first-half 2026 growth rate held every year to 2030; the full-year 2026 figure is the signpost.

## F4.8 Reality check against international analogues

| Analogue | Achieved | Target | Relevance | Source and tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| China, SBM share of feed | Minus 0.14 points a year (USDA and industry basis: 17% in 2017 to about 16% in 2024) to minus 0.45 (official: 17% in 2017 to 13.4% in 2025); 0.9 to 2.9% a year relative, compound; 13.4% in 2025 against a target below 13% | 10% by 2030 (minus 0.68 points a year) | Closest analogue for formulation | [@GEO-10; @GEO-11] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} {fx:trend} |
| EU, EU-origin share of feed protein from oilseeds and protein crops | About 26% (FEFAC, undated); 25.8% in 2025 | 35% by 2035 (plus 0.92 points a year) | Pace for a domestic-origin share once measured | [@VIS-15; @VIS-17] {general\|High} {fx:projection} (EU benchmark) |
| Japan, feed self-sufficiency | 26% (FY2000), 26% (FY2024), 24% provisional (FY2025); FY2030 target cut from 34% to 28% | 28% by FY2030 | Ceiling for land-based self-sufficiency | [@VIS-11; @VIS-12] {VN-adjacent\|High} {fx:trend} |
| Norway, marine share of salmon feed | 90% (1990) to about 30% (2013), minus 2.6 points a year | None | Price can cause fast substitution | [@VIS-18; @VIS-19] {general\|High} {fx:trend} |
| Norway, novel feed ingredients | 0.4% of salmon-feed ingredients (2020) | None | Ceiling for novel feed protein today | [@VIS-18; @VIS-20] {general\|High} |
| Singapore, local protein share (eggs and seafood) | About 26% when "30 by 30" was dropped | 30% by 2035 | A dropped production target | [@VIS-25] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |

**Model cases against the analogues** {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}
- **S-EFF (7.00 Mt in 2050) is credible.** Its minus 1% a year inclusion trend cuts SBM intensity by 22% over 2025 to 2050 (253 to 198 kg per t); China's achieved pace over 25 years would cut it by 20 to 52% (our calculation).
- **S-ALT (8.78 Mt) is a stretch.** Its microbial share of high-protein feed protein is 1.0% (2030), 2.7% (2035), 4.4% (2040) and 8.4% (2050). Norway's 0.4% makes the 2030 value plausible and the 2050 value unprecedented.
- **S-HIGH (11.72 Mt) is an upside risk.**

**Credible ambitious range (context).** On this evidence, a credible ambitious range for Vietnam's SBM need in 2050 is about 7 to 9 Mt (7.0 to 8.8 Mt, the S-EFF to S-ALT span), against 10.4 Mt on trend {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Matching ranges are 7.8 to 8.3 Mt (2030), 8.1 to 9.0 Mt (2035) and 7.8 to 9.2 Mt (2040), with microbial feed protein at about 1% of high-protein feed protein by 2030 and 4 to 8% by 2050 {fx:estimate}. Holding imports at the 2025 level (7.2 Mt) through 2050 is a stretch case. With no combined S-EFF plus S-ALT run, the range has no value below S-EFF. The study sets no soybean-meal goal: [[ch22-protein-balance-2050]] (section 22.5) gives this range as context, and the vision in [[ch24-vision-2050]] no longer uses it.

## F4.9 Reproduce, extend, limits and disagreements

### F4.9.1 How to rerun

- **Requirements:** Python 3, standard library; nothing is fetched from the web. **Input:** `data/balance_assumptions.csv`. **Outputs:** `data/balance_outputs.csv` and `data/balance_sensitivity.csv`, plus a console summary.
- **Warning:** the script takes no arguments. `--help` or any argument is ignored, and every run overwrites both output files. To experiment, run a copy: `mkdir -p run/tools run/data`, copy `tools/balance_model.py` to `run/tools/` and `data/balance_assumptions.csv` to `run/data/`, then `python3 run/tools/balance_model.py`.
- **Check:** on 24 September 2026 a run in a clean copy reproduced both package files byte for byte.
- **Working paper:** `working-papers/wave3/balance_model/model.py` is the same model with stream paths and no record IDs.

### F4.9.2 How to extend

| Task | What to change |
|---|---|
| Change an assumption | The value in `balance_assumptions.csv` for the scenario tag and year |
| Add a scenario | Rows under a new tag for parameters that differ; add the tag to `SCENARIOS` and `PARENT`. Avoided-import indicators are computed only for S-ALT |
| Combine S-EFF and S-ALT | New tag with parent S-EFF; copy the S-ALT share rows (BLA-190 to BLA-214) |
| Add a sensitivity | SENS-LOW and SENS-HIGH rows, plus one entry in `SENS_SPECS` |
| New OECD-FAO edition | Fetch with the F4.2.1 recipe; recompute the 2030 and 2035 index rows and the dressing-yield and SSR rows |
| Industry aquafeed base | Set `base_aquafeed_mt` to 4.35 |

### F4.9.3 Limitations

- FCRs, inclusion rates and compound shares are assumptions calibrated to national totals; no Vietnamese series by species exists in the sources we reached.
- Self-sufficiency, export shares, domestic maize output and non-feed maize are held constant; population is the same in all scenarios.
- No prices, so no statement on competitiveness ([[app-f3-frontier-tech]]).
- No climate impacts on Vietnamese farming or on exporters' yields ([[ch20-drivers-2050]]).
- Emissions cover only electricity for alternative protein; land-use change is excluded.
- Microbial protein replaces SBM and fishmeal one for one on crude protein, with no digestibility or amino-acid adjustment. S-ALT food substitution touches meat only.
- The 2040 and 2050 values extend beyond any published projection.

### F4.9.4 Disagreements with published numbers

We give both values and the position taken; these belong in [[app-r2-disagreements]].

| Topic | Published or other value | Ours | Position taken |
|---|---|---|---|
| Maize imports, 2035 | OECD-FAO 16.6 Mt [@QNT-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} | 13.9 Mt | Feed use agrees within 3%. The gap is non-feed use (OECD-FAO 4.4 Mt; ours 1.61 Mt, from USDA's split) and domestic output (OECD-FAO +1.4% a year; ours flat as area shrinks [@MAC-01]). Kept ours; the E10 and output tests (2.8 and 3.3 Mt) span the gap |
| Maize imports, 2027 | USDA Post 15 Mt, MY2026/27 [@MAC-03] {fx:projection} | About 12.3 Mt | Not reconciled: marketing year and possible stock building against our calendar-year customs base |
| Fishmeal feed use, 2035 | OECD-FAO 339 kt, +4.4% a year [@QNT-01] {fx:projection} | 274 kt | Kept ours (inclusion falling 1.5% a year, slower than the 1997 to 2017 fall [@FM-05]); direction uncertain; both below 350 kt |
| Meat target, 2030 | 6.0 to 6.5 Mt cwe; 58 to 62 kg per person [@MAC-23; @REG-54] {fx:projection} | 2025 output already 6.04 Mt (59.4 kg) | The target looks met on NSO data: either it is conservative or NSO live weights run high. Flagged, not resolved |
| USDA soy balance, MY2026/27 | 6.85 Mt of meal plus 3.5 Mt of beans imported, and 8.8 Mt of meal consumption [@QNT-07], against 7.8 Mt of SBM feed use [@MAC-04] | 7.7 Mt of demand (2027) | Implies stock building or other uses; not resolved; we follow feed use |
| 2025 aquafeed | USDA 6.5 Mt [@MAC-01] | Industry 3.9 to 4.8 Mt (our sum of shrimp and fish feed estimates) [@MAC-06] | Unresolved (DG-120); USDA used; 0.02 Mt effect on 2050 SBM |
| Poultry basis | OECD-FAO 2,567 kt (2025), labelled ready to cook; 2,329 kt in 2023 [@QNT-01] | NSO 2,602 kt live weight (2025) [@MAC-14; @MAC-12]; FAOSTAT 1,740 kt carcass weight (2023) [@DIE-07] | The OECD-FAO level is 34% above FAOSTAT in 2023 (our calculation); we use OECD-FAO growth rates only, as before (DG-360) |
| Aquaculture base, 2025 | OECD-FAO 5.69 Mt [@QNT-01] | NSO 6.12 Mt [@MAC-15] | NSO base, OECD-FAO growth |
| Gas-route electricity | 25 kWh per kg of biomass (lower case) and 9.86 (laboratory) [@QNT-10]; about 69 MWh per t of protein for a 2030 design [@FTG-01], used in [[ch21-frontier-technology]] {general\|Medium} | 41 kWh per kg of protein | Kept 41. With FTG-01's factor, S-ALT would need about 19 TWh in 2050 (under 2% of planned supply) and the CO2 break-even against SBM would be about 12 g per kWh, not 21 (our calculation). Not yet reconciled |
| Hydrogen per kg of single-cell protein | 2.41 kg (via [@QNT-14]) {general\|Low} | 0.72 kg per kg of protein | Ours matches stoichiometry and FTG-01 (0.69 t per t); 2.41 is probably a different basis |

> **Correction.** Earlier versions said OECD-FAO "probably uses live weight" for poultry. The OECD data label poultry as ready to cook, not live weight; its 2023 level (2,329 kt) is 34% above the FAOSTAT carcass-weight figure (1,740 kt) [@QNT-01; @DIE-07] {VN-direct|Medium}. The model is unchanged: it uses OECD-FAO growth rates only (DG-360).

## F4.10 Gaps and open questions

These go to [[app-r1-open-questions]].

| Gap | Why it matters | Cheapest way to close it |

| MAE confirmation of the scope of the 30 to 32 Mt target | OQ-127 answered only at Medium confidence | One enquiry to the MAE Department of Livestock Production and Animal Health |
| USDA long-term country tables (maize and SBM to 2035) | A second projection beside OECD-FAO | USDA ERS International Baseline data tables |
| OECD-FAO poultry base | May overstate poultry by about 30% | FAOSTAT; the Aglink-Cosimo team |
| Share of pig feed that is compound feed | Sets industrialisation growth | 2025 agricultural census; MAE farm-size statistics |

| USDA marketing-year balances against customs data | The 2027 SBM and maize checks do not close | USDA PSD tables; monthly customs data |
| Land-use-change emissions of imported soy by origin | Could change the climate case | Trase supply-chain data |
| Vietnam-specific 2050 demand projection | Our 2040 and 2050 values are extensions | IMPACT country results (no Vietnam value in [@QNT-12]); IFPRI |
| Gas-route energy factor (41 against 69 kWh per kg of protein) | Consistency of Part IV energy and carbon numbers | Reconcile with `frontier_gas_tech.csv` |
| Combined S-EFF plus S-ALT run | No value below S-EFF in the credible range | One new scenario tag (F4.9.2) |
