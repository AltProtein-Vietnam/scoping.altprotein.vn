# S4. Feedstock data sheets

This appendix is the evidence base behind [[ch04-asset-map]]. It has one data sheet for each raw material or side stream that a protein process in Vietnam could use: crops, crop residues, food-industry side streams, aquatic biomass and co-products of industrial fermentation. Most of these streams bring carbon, not protein. So each sheet says whether the stream brings protein, carbon or both, and what process would turn it into a protein product.

The study is about protein for people. Many of these streams are sold as animal feed today, and some of the research on them is feed research. The sheets keep that evidence, because feed is what each stream competes with. Where a sheet names a feed product under "What it could become", it records the earlier assessment: feed is now context only, not a target.

## How to read the data sheets

- **Terms.** DM is dry matter. CP is crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25). "Wet" means as produced, before drying. Mt is million tonnes, kt is thousand tonnes.
- **Abbreviations.** MSG is monosodium glutamate. DDG and DDGS are distillers' dried grains (without and with solubles), the residue of grain ethanol. SCP is single-cell protein (microbial biomass). COD is chemical oxygen demand, a measure of the organic load in wastewater. HFCS is high-fructose corn syrup. E10 is petrol blended with 10% ethanol. FOB (free on board) and CIF (cost, insurance and freight) are export and delivered price bases. MY is a USDA marketing year. DIAAS and PDCAAS are measures of protein quality.
- **Organisations.** NSO is the National Statistics Office. MAE is the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and MOIT the Ministry of Industry and Trade. USDA is the United States Department of Agriculture. VFA is the Vietnam Food Association. QNS is Quang Ngai Sugar. HUST is Hanoi University of Science and Technology. EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority. GFI APAC is the Good Food Institute Asia Pacific. VASEP is the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers.
- **Measured or derived.** "Measured" means a statistics office, ministry, customs service, company or peer-reviewed study published the number for that stream. "Derived" means we calculated it from a sourced volume and a sourced ratio. Every derived number shows its arithmetic and says "(our calculation)". Derived numbers carry Low confidence unless stated.
- **Prices.** Prices are in VND per kg unless stated, with the date and the basis (farm-gate, factory-gate, wholesale, retail, FOB). We convert at 26,000 VND per USD.
- **Provinces.** We use the current (post-1 July 2025) province name first and give the former unit in brackets, for example Tay Ninh (former Long An). See [[app-s10-admin-map]].
- **Fields.** Every sheet uses the same fields: volume, locations, sites and companies, current use and buyers, prices, composition, seasonality and storage, competing uses, what it could become, evidence gaps and sources. "Not established" means we looked and found no usable figure. It does not mean the stream is small.
- **Tags.** `{VN-direct|High}` and similar tags follow the evidence rules in [[app-m1-method]].

> **Method note.** Our wave 1 web-search budget ran out part of the way through the feedstock work. We researched cassava, rice, sugar, beer, soy and fuel ethanol on the open web. We covered seaweed, spirulina, duckweed, mushrooms, cashew, coffee, jackfruit and pulses only through the peer-reviewed literature, so those sheets are thin. Where a sheet is thin, it says so, and the gap table at the end lists what is missing.

**What the table says.** Three points stand out.

1. The large streams are carbohydrate: cassava pulp, rice bran and husk, molasses and surplus sugar. Any route from them to protein needs added nitrogen and a microbial step.
2. The protein-rich side streams are small, or are animal protein. Brewer's spent grain holds at most about 32 to 35 kt of protein a year and okara (tofu and soymilk residue) at most about 30 to 37 kt (see C16 and C19). Seafood by-products are animal protein. For scale, Vietnam fed 7.2 Mt of soybean meal to animals in 2025 [@MAC-04] {VN-direct|Medium}.
3. Public data cannot size the novel biomasses (seaweed, spirulina, duckweed, mushrooms). Any plan that relies on them has to start by collecting primary data.

## Cassava

### C1. Cassava roots (*sắn*, *khoai mì*: cassava)

- **Volume.** The domestic harvest was 10.24 Mt of fresh roots on 499,100 ha in 2025, a yield of 20.5 t/ha. Area fell by 18,600 ha and output by 295,110 t compared with 2024 [@FS-01] {VN-direct|High}. This is measured (Statistics Office data reported in the press). In August 2026 an MAE crop official gave about 517,000 ha and about 10.5 Mt, which match the 2024 values implied by [@FS-01] (our calculation) [@FS-08] {VN-direct|Medium}. Total factory supply is above 18 Mt of roots a year, of which about 42% (about 8 Mt) is imported, mainly from Cambodia and Laos [@FS-14] {VN-direct|Medium}. The vice-chair of the Vietnam Cassava Association puts factory demand at about 20 Mt against about 10 Mt of domestic roots [@FS-07] {VN-direct|Low}. About 85% of roots go to industry (starch, ethanol, MSG and chips) [@FS-08] {VN-direct|Medium}. About 1.2 million households grow cassava [@FS-14] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Imports.** Cambodia exported 3.1 Mt of fresh roots (down 10%) and 1.56 Mt of chips (up 62%) to all destinations in 2025. Its cassava exports were worth USD 489 M in the first 8 months of 2026 (down 1.9%), and its cassava area fell about 30% [@FS-15] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. The border provinces through which imports enter (Tay Ninh, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Quang Tri) are our inference, not a sourced finding.
- **Locations.** Tay Ninh (about 61,000 ha and more than 2 Mt a year) [@FS-03] {VN-direct|Medium}; Gia Lai (former Gia Lai and Binh Dinh, with the Quy Nhon export port); Dak Lak (former Dak Lak and Phu Yen); Quang Ngai (former Quang Ngai and Kon Tum); Dong Nai (former Binh Phuoc); Son La; Thanh Hoa [@FS-03; @FS-07; @FS-11; @FS-16; @FS-21; @FS-22] {VN-direct|Medium}. We found no ranked provincial table, so we give no provincial shares.
- **Sites and companies.** Roots are bought by starch factories (see C2), chip traders, the three operating fuel-ethanol plants (see C32) and the MSG makers Vedan, Ajinomoto and Daesang ([[app-s5-facilities]]).
- **Current use and buyers.** Starch, chips, ethanol and MSG. Compound feed used 550 kt of cassava in 2025, forecast to reach 645 kt in 2027 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Prices.** Root prices rose by roughly half to almost double in a year (about 50 to 75% in Tay Ninh):

| Market | 9 Apr 2026, VND/kg | Apr 2025, VND/kg | Basis | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tay Ninh (30% starch) | 3,000 to 3,500 | about 2,000 (up 1,000 to 1,500, about 50 to 75%) | factory gate | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Dak Lak (30% starch) | 3,000 to 3,498 | 1,800 to 1,998 | factory gate | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Quang Ngai (30% starch) | 3,099 to 3,300 | not given | factory gate | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Gia Lai (30% starch) | 3,399 to 3,549 | 1,800 to 1,950 | factory gate | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Northern region (bulk) | 2,400 to 2,700 | 1,350 to 1,650 | factory gate | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| National range, end of Q1 2026 | 2,850 to 3,550 | n/a | not stated | [@FS-12] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Thailand benchmark, Mar 2026 | 3.35 to 3.55 THB/kg | n/a | factory gate | [@FS-12] | {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |

  The press gives three causes: farmers left cassava after low prices in 2025, cassava mosaic disease, and a sharp fall in imports from Cambodia [@FS-11] {VN-direct|Medium}. Vedan's 2025 annual report says cassava prices rose in Q4 2025 [@VCO-01]; its 2026 interim results say they "rose sharply" from Q4 2025 through H1 2026, and that molasses had become tight [@VCO-02] {VN-direct|High}. At 30% starch, a root price of 3,000 to 3,550 VND/kg means 10,000 to 11,800 VND per kg of starch contained in the root, before any processing cost (our calculation from [@FS-11], 3,000 / 0.30 and 3,550 / 0.30). That is close to the native starch price of 12,500 to 13,200 VND/kg at the end of Q1 2026 [@FS-12] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Composition.** Roots are traded on a 30% starch basis [@FS-11]. Conversion ratios: 2.5 t of fresh roots per t of dry chips [@FS-08] {VN-direct|Medium}; about 4.4 t of roots per t of starch (Thai material balance) [@FS-05] {VN-adjacent|Medium}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** The main harvest runs from about October or November to April (regional knowledge, not sourced). By late March 2026, 70 to 80% of the area had been harvested [@FS-12] {VN-direct|Medium}. The starch campaign follows the harvest.
- **Competing uses.** Starch for export to China (C2); chips and fuel ethanol under the E10 mandate, in force nationwide from 1 June 2026 [@GT-10; @FS-10] {VN-direct|High}; MSG; feed.
- **What it could become.** Roots are a carbon source. Thermotolerant yeast can ferment raw cassava starch directly: *Kluyveromyces marxianus* SS106, isolated from Thai cassava pulp, reached 36 to 46 g/L of cell mass at 40 C on raw cassava starch in 5 L reactors [@SCI-44] {VN-adjacent|High}. At 2026 prices, roots are the expensive way to buy carbon. Residues (C3, C4) and surplus sugar (C15) are the comparison.
- **Evidence gaps.** Provincial output shares; import volumes by border gate; the weekly bulletins of the Vietnam Cassava Association (its site failed on a certificate error during our research).
- **Sources.** [@FS-01; @FS-03; @FS-05; @FS-07; @FS-08; @FS-10; @FS-11; @FS-12; @FS-14; @FS-15; @FS-16; @FS-21; @FS-22; @FS-23; @GT-10; @SCI-44; @VCO-01; @VCO-02]

### C2. Cassava starch and chips (*tinh bột sắn*, *sắn lát*)

- **Volume.** China imported 2.28 Mt of Vietnamese cassava starch worth USD 809.9 M in the first 11 months of 2025, up 69.8% in volume (Chinese customs data) [@FS-01] {VN-direct|High}. Scaled to 12 months that is about 2.49 Mt (our calculation, 2.28 x 12 / 11). Total cassava exports were 3.99 Mt worth USD 1.27 bn in 2025 [@FS-01] {VN-direct|High}. China took about 94% of the 2025 volume (3.76 of 3.99 Mt) [@FS-01] and more than 92.5% of the October 2025 volume [@FS-13] {VN-direct|High}. After 9 months of 2025, Vietnam held 48.8% of China's cassava-starch imports, ahead of Thailand [@FS-13] {VN-direct|High}. Earlier years: 2.15 Mt worth USD 1.06 bn in 2023, 93.5% to China (Vietnam-reported) [@RGN-53]; 39% of China's cassava-starch imports in 2024, 1.56 Mt worth USD 757 M (China-reported) [@RGN-51] {VN-direct|High}. Exports to mid-March 2026 were 1.06 Mt worth USD 359.4 M, of which starch was more than 64% of volume [@FS-12] {VN-direct|Medium}. Domestic starch use (MSG, paper, food, modified starch) is not quantified in any source we read.
- **Chips.** Chip exports to China were 955,670 t in 11 months of 2025 [@FS-01] and raw cassava (*sắn thô*) exports were 967,460 t in 10 months [@FS-13] {VN-direct|Medium}. The second figure is not labelled as chips. We use the first figure for chips and log the conflict in [[app-r2-disagreements]].
- **Factories.** The count is disputed. About 100 industrial mills (MOIT, 2021) [@FS-04]; about 120 in 27 provinces with 11.3 Mt of design and 8.62 Mt of actual root capacity (ASEAN Cassava Centre, January 2023) [@FS-02]; "150+" factories averaging 300 to 350 t of roots a day (Nong nghiep va Moi truong newspaper, 12 October 2025) [@FS-07] {VN-direct|Medium}. Older data list over 4,000 small units [@FS-17] {VN-direct|Low}. We use "120 to 150" and cite all three. Tay Ninh alone has 68 factories with 6.4 Mt a year of root capacity (December 2024) [@FS-03] or 65 factories (October 2025) [@FS-07] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Example sites.** Dinh Khue (Tan Chau, Tay Ninh), 280 t of roots a day [@FS-03]. Son La Starch Factory, 100,000 t of roots in and 30,000 t of starch out planned for 2019/20 [@FS-22]. Long Giang Thinh, over 50,000 t of roots a year [@FS-04]. Vina Thanh Hoa (Ngoc Lac, Thanh Hoa) [@FS-21]. FOCOCEV in Dong Nai (former Binh Phuoc) [@FS-17]. Hung Duy Group (Tay Ninh) [@FS-07] {VN-direct|Medium}. Vedan's native starch nameplates are 72,000 t/yr at Phuoc Thai (1994) and 72,000 t/yr at Phuoc Long (1998), plus two 36,000 t/yr lines (2000 and 2001), and 10,000 and 30,000 t/yr of modified starch (1998 and 2000). These are historic nameplates, not confirmed as current [@VCO-03] {VN-direct|Medium}. Daesang runs a starch plant in Tay Ninh (2005) [@IND-11] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Current use and buyers.** Export (more than 90% to China) [@FS-01] {VN-direct|High}; domestic MSG, food, paper and modified starch; chips to ethanol plants, feed mills and export.
- **Prices.**

| Product and market | Price | Date | Basis | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Native starch, domestic | 12,500 to 13,200 VND/kg | end of Q1 2026 | wholesale | [@FS-12] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Native starch, FOB Ho Chi Minh City | USD 405 to 415/t | Jan 2026 | export | [@FS-01] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Native starch, FOB Ho Chi Minh City | USD 520 to 540/t (up USD 145 to 155 on Apr 2025) | 6 Apr 2026 (article 9 Apr) | export | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Native starch, Thailand | 15.60 THB/kg | Mar 2026 | wholesale | [@FS-12] | {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |
| Chips, domestic | 5,800 to 6,200 VND/kg | end of Q1 2026 | wholesale | [@FS-12] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Chips, FOB Quy Nhon | about USD 235/t | Jan 2026 | export | [@FS-01] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Chips, FOB Quy Nhon | USD 260/t (to China) and USD 315/t (to Korea) | 6 Apr 2026 (article 9 Apr) | export | [@FS-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |

- **Composition.** Native starch is close to pure carbohydrate. Vedan built 140,000 t/yr of glucose syrup capacity (1995 nameplate) and lists glucose syrup for sale to third parties [@VCO-03; @IND-01] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** The campaign follows the harvest (C1). Actual root capacity (8.62 Mt) is well below design capacity (11.3 Mt) [@FS-02] {VN-direct|Medium}. Running below capacity outside the harvest season is a likely reason (our inference).
- **Competing uses.** Export demand from China; fuel ethanol (chips); MSG.
- **What it could become.** Starch and glucose syrup are the most ready-to-use fermentation carbon in Vietnam, and they are already made at scale next to the aerobic fermenters of Vedan and Daesang. Starch is also the binder in most *đồ chay* (traditional vegetarian food) analogues ([[app-s2-retail-audit]]).
- **Evidence gaps.** National starch output including domestic use (MOIT or NSO industrial product tables); a reconciled chip export series.

### C3. Cassava pulp (*bã sắn*, *bã mì*: starch residue)

- **Volume.** About 6.2 Mt wet (range 4 to 8 Mt), about 1.2 Mt DM, in 2025. This is derived from Thai ratios applied to Vietnamese export volumes (table below) [@FS-01; @FS-05]. No government body publishes the number. {VN-adjacent|Low}

  | Step | Value | Source |
  |---|---|---|
  | Starch output proxy, 2025 | 2.28 Mt (11-month exports to China) x 12 / 11 = 2.49 Mt | [@FS-01] |
  | Pulp per t of starch | 2.5 t wet, at 79.4% moisture | [@FS-05; @FS-06; @FS-53] |
  | Roots per t of starch | 4.4 t | [@FS-05] |
  | Wet pulp | 2.49 x 2.5 = 6.2 Mt | our calculation |
  | Dry matter | 6.2 x (1 - 0.794) = 1.28 Mt | our calculation |
  | Per t of roots | 2.5 / 4.4 = 0.57 t wet, or 0.12 t DM | our calculation |
  | Roots behind 2025 starch output | 2.49 x 4.4 = about 11 Mt | our calculation |
  | 2024 equivalent | 11-month 2024 exports to China about 1.34 Mt (2.28 / 1.698), about 1.47 Mt full year, x 2.5 = about 3.7 Mt wet | our calculation from [@FS-01] |

  Biases: domestic starch use would push the total up; any re-export of starch made in Cambodia or Laos would push it down; pulp pressed to about 65% moisture, as in a Vietnamese pelleting trial [@FS-17], would cut the wet tonnage but not the DM; fresh factory pulp is 80 to 85% moisture. Vietnamese wet-basis factory figures agree with the ratio: 30 to 100 t of roots a day gave 12 to 48 t of pulp, a ratio of 0.40 to 0.48 [@FS-16], and over 30,000 t of pulp came from over 50,000 t of roots, about 0.6 [@FS-04] {VN-direct|Low}. Other published ratios use different moisture bases: 10 to 15% of root weight (Sriroth et al., quoted in a Lao study; basis not stated) [@FS-18] and 20 to 30% of root weight (review, basis not stated) [@FS-20] {VN-adjacent|Low}. Thailand's national figure, 9.5 Mt of pulp a year, fits the same material balance [@FS-06] {VN-adjacent|Medium}.

> **Correction.** Earlier drafts gave 1.7 to 2.1 Mt of wet pulp a year, without a source. That is too low for wet pulp unless it refers to pressed or partly dried pulp. A 2018 Vietnamese paper's "about 4 Mt; 10 to 15% of roots = 3.8 to 5.4 Mt" is inconsistent: it applies 10 to 15% to 38 Mt of processing capacity, while the same paper gives a 10.9 Mt harvest [@FS-17]. We use about 6 Mt wet (range 4 to 8 Mt) for 2025. The volume swings with Chinese starch demand: the 2024 equivalent was only about 3.7 Mt.

- **Protein content.** All the pulp in Vietnam contains only about 19 to 31 kt of protein a year (our calculation: 1.2 Mt DM x 1.55 to 2.6% CP). Pulp is a carbon source, not a protein source.
- **Locations.** Every starch factory; the largest cluster is Tay Ninh (65 to 68 factories, 6.4 Mt a year of root capacity) [@FS-03; @FS-07] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Sites and companies.** Dinh Khue (Tay Ninh) sells 3,500 t of pulp a year for VND 6 bn [@FS-03]. Son La Starch Factory dries pulp and sells it to feed mills in Ninh Binh (former Ha Nam) and Bac Ninh (former Bac Giang) [@FS-22]. Vina Thanh Hoa sells dried pulp [@FS-21]. FOCOCEV supplied pulp for a pelleting trial [@FS-17] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Current use and buyers.** Fresh pulp goes to cattle and pig farms. Sun- or drum-dried pulp goes to feed mills. Pulp is also pelleted, fed to biogas digesters for boiler heat, or used as fertiliser [@FS-03; @FS-17; @FS-22] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Prices.** We found no current published gate price.

| Signal | Value | Date | Basis | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Implied price, Dinh Khue | about 1,700 VND/kg (VND 6 bn / 3,500 t), product form not stated | Dec 2024 | factory gate | [@FS-03] | {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Wet pulp (Dong Nai, Gia Lai, Tay Ninh) | 200 VND/kg | 2005 | not stated | [@FS-16] | {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Dried pulp (Dong Nai, Gia Lai, Tay Ninh) | 800 to 1,000 VND/kg | 2005 | not stated | [@FS-16] | {VN-direct\|Low} |
| "Other by-products (cassava, pumpkin, cane tops)" | 2,000 to 5,000 VND/kg | 2025 | reference list | [@FS-30] | {VN-direct\|Low} |

  If the 1,700 VND/kg were for wet pulp at about 80% moisture, it would equal about 8,500 VND per kg of DM (our calculation, 1,700 / 0.2), more than dried cassava chips at 5,800 to 6,200 VND/kg [@FS-12]. So it is more plausibly a price for dried or pressed pulp. Model pulp at a positive price.
- **Composition.** On a DM basis: starch about 54 to 70%; cellulose 4 to 25%; hemicellulose 4 to 13%; lignin 1 to 7%; CP 1.55 to 2.6%; ash 2 to 12%; energy about 13 MJ/kg [@FS-03; @FS-05; @FS-06; @FS-18; @FS-19; @FS-20] {VN-adjacent|Low}. Fresh pulp is 77 to 85% moisture [@FS-05; @FS-17; @FS-19] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. A Lao sample had 23.6% DM and 2.6% CP in DM [@FS-19] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. A commercial Vietnamese dried-pulp specification gives starch 40 to 50%, moisture 10 to 16% and fibre 14 to 20% [@FS-21] {VN-direct|Low}. The starch in all Vietnamese pulp is about 0.65 to 0.84 Mt a year (our calculation, 1.2 Mt DM x 54 to 70%).
- **Seasonality and storage.** Pulp is produced with the starch campaign (C2). It ferments on its own in open pits (pH 3.2 to 3.5). In a Lao study, pulp stored for up to 4 years was less than 10% below fresh root in an in vitro test on one sample, and only the top 50 cm spoiled [@FS-18] {VN-adjacent|High}. Pit storage is a cheap way to run a year-round process on a seasonal stream.
- **Competing uses.** Cattle and pig farms, feed mills and biogas. Rising root prices and the E10 mandate raise the value of every cassava fraction.
- **What it could become.** A carbon source for fungal or yeast biomass after hydrolysis, with added nitrogen (urea or ammonium salts). An earlier version assessed this route for feed protein; feed is now context only, and a food product would first need the safety data listed under evidence gaps. Relevant evidence: *Candida utilis* on cassava peel hydrolysate (C4) [@SCI-22]; *K. marxianus* from Thai cassava pulp (C1) [@SCI-44]; oyster-mushroom mycelium in solid-state fermentation of cassava plus soy residue raised protein 1.84-fold (preprint, 2025) [@RD-29] {VN-direct|Low}. Biogas from pulp and wastewater could supply methane for methanotroph protein (C5). Theoretical ceiling: 0.65 to 0.84 Mt of pulp starch (see Composition, our calculation), at 0.44 to 0.52 g of biomass per g of sugar and 47.5 to 56.7% CP (the values for the yeast *C. utilis* in [@SCI-22]), gives about 0.14 to 0.25 Mt of crude protein a year (our calculation; it assumes all pulp is collected and all starch hydrolysed, ignores the mass gain on hydrolysis, and counts nucleic-acid nitrogen as protein). It is a ceiling, not a forecast. For context, the fishmeal in Vietnamese shrimp feed is about 92 to 184 kt a year ([[app-s6-feed-market]]).
- **Evidence gaps.** Gate prices, and the split between wet sale, drying, biogas and dumping; a Vietnamese material balance (wet and DM per t of roots) across 10 or more factories and seasons; food-grade safety data (cyanide, mycotoxins, nucleic acid) for any fungal product.
- **Sources.** [@FS-01; @FS-03; @FS-04; @FS-05; @FS-06; @FS-07; @FS-12; @FS-16; @FS-17; @FS-18; @FS-19; @FS-20; @FS-21; @FS-22; @FS-30; @FS-53; @RD-29; @SCI-22; @SCI-44]

### C4. Cassava peel and rhizomes (*vỏ sắn*, *đầu mặt*, *xơ*)

- **Volume.** Derived from the Thai material balance per t of starch: 100 kg of peel, 600 kg of rhizomes and 170 kg of sand [@FS-53] {VN-adjacent|Low}. At 2.49 Mt of starch that gives about 0.25 Mt of peel, 1.5 Mt of rhizomes and 0.42 Mt of sand in 2025 (our calculation). One Vietnamese factory reports over 5,000 t of peel from over 50,000 t of roots, about 10% of roots [@FS-04] {VN-direct|Low}. At 10% of the roughly 11 Mt of roots behind 2025 starch output, peel would be about 1.1 Mt (our calculation). The two bases clearly define "peel" differently. We do not average them.
- **Locations and sites.** All starch factories (C2).
- **Current use and buyers.** Fertiliser, biogas and some feed; use is limited [@FS-04; @FS-06] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Prices.** None found.
- **Composition.** Not found for Vietnamese material.
- **Seasonality and storage.** With the starch campaign.
- **Competing uses.** Few; mainly compost and biogas.
- **What it could become.** Yeast single-cell protein: *C. utilis* grown on cassava peel hydrolysates reached 47.5% CP (glucose hydrolysate), 49.1% (acid) and 56.7% (enzymatic), with 0.44 to 0.52 g of biomass per g of sugar and a maximum growth temperature of 41 C. These are crude protein values that include nucleic-acid nitrogen, from a low-tier journal [@SCI-22] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. Grey oyster mushroom has been grown on cassava peel waste from starch production in Vietnam [@RD-64] {VN-direct|Low}. A food product would need cyanide, mycotoxin and nucleic-acid testing.
- **Evidence gaps.** Volume on a stated moisture basis; composition; current disposal cost.
- **Sources.** [@FS-04; @FS-06; @FS-53; @RD-64; @SCI-22]

### C5. Cassava starch wastewater and biogas (*nước thải tinh bột sắn*)

- **Volume.** Long Giang Thinh reports over 100,000 m3 of wastewater a year from over 50,000 t of roots, about 2 m3 per t of roots [@FS-04] {VN-direct|Low}. The national total is not published. Thailand reports about 21 million m3 a year alongside 9.5 Mt of pulp [@FS-06] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. If the one-factory ratio held nationally, the roughly 11 Mt of roots behind 2025 starch output would give about 22 million m3 (our calculation, 11 x 2), similar in scale to Thailand. Low confidence.
- **Locations and sites.** All starch factories.
- **Current use.** Some factories use biogas for drying; one reports that biogas covers 50 to 55% of its drying energy, with coal for the rest [@FS-04; @FS-06] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Prices.** None; treatment is a cost.
- **Composition.** High in organic load (COD); values not found for Vietnamese factories.
- **Competing uses.** Biogas for boiler heat.
- **What it could become.** Biogas methane is a possible feedstock for methanotroph single-cell protein. It is not quantified nationally. Separately, the Dung Quat ethanol plant plans to research low-carbon methanol from biogenic CO2 from Q4 2026, a possible CO2 or methanol feedstock lead [@FS-09] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Evidence gaps.** National wastewater volume and COD; biogas output per factory; whether biogas is surplus to boiler needs.
- **Sources.** [@FS-04; @FS-06; @FS-09]

## Rice

### C6. Rice paddy (*lúa*)

- **Volume.** 43.5 Mt of paddy on 7.13 million ha in calendar 2025 [@FS-25] {VN-direct|High}. USDA gives 42.96 Mt of paddy and 26.85 Mt of milled rice on 7.02 million ha for MY2024/25, and forecasts 41.92 Mt (MY2025/26) and 41.76 Mt (MY2026/27) [@FS-23] {VN-direct|Medium}. The periods differ; we use NSO for calendar 2025.
- **Locations.** Mekong Delta: An Giang (former An Giang and Kien Giang), Dong Thap (former Dong Thap and Tien Giang), Can Tho (former Can Tho, Soc Trang and Hau Giang), Vinh Long (former Vinh Long, Tra Vinh and Ben Tre), Tay Ninh (former Long An) and Ca Mau (former Ca Mau and Bac Lieu); also the Red River Delta. This list is regional knowledge; we did not source provincial shares.
- **Sites and companies.** Thousands of mills; state and private exporters.
- **Current use and buyers.** Food and export. Paddy is the parent of broken rice (C7), bran (C8), husk (C9) and straw (C10).
- **Prices.** Fresh paddy 5,700 to 6,200 VND/kg in An Giang on 19 September 2026 [@FS-26] {VN-direct|Medium}. IR50404 paddy 5,326 VND/kg and 5%-broken milled rice 14,000 VND/kg in March 2026 [@COST-33] {VN-direct|Medium}. Fragrant 5%-broken rice, VFA export quote, USD 440 to 445/t on 19 September 2026 [@FS-26] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Seasonality.** Two to three crops a year in the Mekong Delta.
- **Evidence gaps.** Provincial shares of output and milling.
- **Sources.** [@COST-33; @FS-23; @FS-25; @FS-26]

### C7. Broken rice (*tấm*)

- **Volume.** Vietnam exported 872,576 t of 100% broken rice in 2025, mostly to Africa [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}. Total broken-rice output and its split by use were not found. USDA's feed table counts bran and broken rice together: 2.8 Mt of domestic supply went into feed in 2025, forecast 3.0 Mt in 2026 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Locations and sites.** Mekong Delta mills and exporters.
- **Current use and buyers.** Export, feed, rice flour and noodles, beer adjunct. The split was not found.
- **Prices.** Fragrant broken rice (grade 3 to 4) 8,500 to 8,600 VND/kg in An Giang; VFA export quotes for fragrant rice of USD 368 to 372/t for 100% broken, against USD 440 to 445/t for 5%-broken, on 19 September 2026 [@FS-26] {VN-direct|Medium}. That is a discount of about 15 to 17% (our calculation, 368 / 445 and 372 / 440). Broken rice is a food-grade starch sold at close to the price of rice.
- **Composition.** Mostly starch. Rice protein alone is poor quality: brown-rice protein concentrate scored a DIAAS of 42 in pigs (older child and adult pattern) because it is lysine-limited [@SCI-40] {general|High}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** Year-round; dry and storable.
- **Competing uses.** Food manufacture, export, feed and brewing.
- **What it could become.** A clean, food-grade carbon source for fermentation after hydrolysis to glucose. Rice-protein extraction has been studied in Vietnam, for example by ultrafiltration [@RD-24] {VN-direct|Medium}, but texturisation has not been published.
- **Evidence gaps.** Total broken-rice volume and uses (Vietnam Food Association).
- **Sources.** [@FS-23; @FS-26; @RD-24; @SCI-40]

### C8. Rice bran (*cám gạo*)

- **Volume.** About 4.35 Mt in 2025, derived: 43.5 Mt of paddy x 10%, using the ratio of 4.4 Mt of bran per 44 Mt of paddy [@FS-27; @FS-25] {VN-direct|Low}. A trade article claims about 5 Mt (year not stated) [@FS-28] {VN-direct|Low}. Exports were about 1.2 Mt in 2025, about double 2024 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}; earlier, 444 kt in 2021 and 213 kt of bran and cereal by-products to China in January to April 2022 [@FS-28] {VN-direct|Medium}. Cross-check: 2.8 Mt of bran and broken rice in domestic feed plus 1.2 Mt of bran exports is about 4 Mt, close to the derived volume, so bran is essentially fully used. USDA's feed table also lists 545 kt of bran and broken rice as imported in 2025 [@FS-23; @MAC-01] {VN-direct|High}. Our macro data file (`macro_indicators.csv`) labels the same 545 kt as feed use. We could not reconcile the two readings without the PDF.

> **Correction.** Earlier drafts gave 730 kt of bran and broken rice in feed, citing an earlier USDA report. The current USDA feed table (VM2026-0012) gives 2.8 Mt of domestic supply in 2025 [@FS-23].

- **Locations.** Mekong Delta mills: An Giang (former Kien Giang), Dong Thap (former Tien Giang), Can Tho.
- **Sites and companies.** Bran oil: Calofic (extraction plant in Can Tho with collection points in the Mekong Delta, since 2004) and Uni-Bran (since 2012). In 2018 they handled about 10% of Mekong bran, and domestic bran-oil consumption was about 7,700 t (2017) [@FS-29] {VN-direct|Low}. These data are old.
- **Current use and buyers.** Domestic feed, export (including to China [@FS-28]) and bran oil [@FS-29].
- **Prices.**

| Market | Price | Date | Basis | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| An Giang | 7,300 to 7,650 VND/kg | 19 Sep 2026 | wholesale | [@FS-26] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| National cattle-feed reference | 6,500 to 8,500 VND/kg | 2025 | reference list | [@FS-30] | {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Domestic | about USD 0.38/kg, at times | 2022 | peak reported price | [@FS-28] | {VN-direct\|Low} |

- **Composition.** Full-fat bran is about 11% CP: the source's own samples had 11.0% CP full-fat and 13.8% CP defatted [@FS-56] {general|Medium}. Fibre is 6 to 11% and moisture 5 to 15% (Sharif et al. 2014, quoted in [@FS-56]) {general|Medium}. Another study gives 12 to 24% oil in full-fat bran and found bran sampled from Vietnam lower in fat than Australian bran and lower in amino acids than Australian or Thai bran, which suggests partial defatting or dilution in trade [@FS-57] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** Year-round, with peaks after harvests. Full-fat bran turns rancid quickly unless it is stabilised or defatted.
- **Competing uses.** Feed mills, export (including to China [@FS-28]), bran oil [@FS-29]. Exports doubled in 2025 [@FS-23], so expect upward pressure on domestic prices.
- **What it could become.** Rice bran protein isolate (a 2015 Vietnamese study) [@RD-25] {VN-direct|Medium}; defatted bran as a protein and fibre ingredient; fermentation substrate.
- **Evidence gaps.** Current bran-oil capacity; what Chinese buyers do with the bran; stabilisation capacity.
- **Sources.** [@FS-23; @FS-25; @FS-26; @FS-27; @FS-28; @FS-29; @FS-30; @FS-56; @FS-57; @MAC-01; @RD-25]

### C9. Rice husk (*trấu*)

- **Volume.** About 8.7 Mt in 2025, derived: 20% of 43.5 Mt of paddy, using the ratio of 8.8 Mt of husk per 44 Mt of paddy [@FS-27; @FS-25] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Current use and buyers.** Boiler fuel, pellets and ash. Ajinomoto's Bien Hoa plant runs a rice-husk biomass boiler that burns about 100,000 t of husk a year [@IND-09] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Prices.** Rice husk pellets are offered at 2,190 VND/kg (list 2,390; unit inferred) with a calorific value of 3,200 to 3,900 kcal/kg (supplier page, December 2025) [@COST-16] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **What it could become.** Energy, not protein. It is the cheapest steam fuel for a fermentation plant: about 420 to 585 VND of fuel per kg of steam (see [[app-s12-costs]]).
- **Sources.** [@COST-16; @FS-25; @FS-27; @IND-09]

### C10. Rice straw (*rơm rạ*)

- **Volume.** Not established. Earlier drafts gave a ratio-based figure that we could not source.
- **Current use.** Straw is the main substrate for straw mushroom [@FS-55] {general|Low}; other uses were not researched.
- **What it could become.** Mushroom substrate; lignocellulosic carbon after pretreatment.
- **Evidence gaps.** Volume, collection share and burning share.
- **Sources.** [@FS-55]

---

## Sugar

### C11. Sugarcane (*mía*)

- **Volume.** The 2025/26 crop crushed 13.3 Mt of cane for 1.298 Mt of sugar; most mills finished by the end of June 2026 [@FS-31; @FS-33] {VN-direct|High}. The 2024/25 crop crushed 12.4 Mt for 1.3 Mt of sugar [@FS-32] {VN-direct|Medium}. Sugar output has risen four seasons running, to about 180% of 2020/21 [@FS-33] {VN-direct|Medium}. About 220,000 farm households grow cane [@FS-33] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Locations.** Gia Lai had over 40,000 ha of cane and its mills made 215,000 t of sugar; Dak Lak (former Phu Yen) had over 26,000 ha (2023/24) [@FS-34] {VN-direct|Medium}. Other areas (Thanh Hoa, Tay Ninh, Nghe An) are regional knowledge, not sourced.
- **Sites and companies.** 25 operating mills with 124,000 t of cane a day of design capacity (as of late 2024) [@FS-34] {VN-direct|Medium}. Quang Ngai Sugar (QNS) at An Khe (Gia Lai) plans to expand its biomass power plant to 135 MW and targets 40,000 ha of cane by 2027/28 [@FS-35] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Current use.** Sugar, molasses (C12), bagasse power (C13).
- **Seasonality.** The crush runs from about November to June.
- **Sources.** [@FS-31; @FS-32; @FS-33; @FS-34; @FS-35]

### C12. Molasses (*rỉ đường*, *rỉ mật*)

- **Volume.** 0.55 to 0.72 Mt in 2025/26 and 0.52 to 0.67 Mt in 2024/25, derived {general|Low}. Arithmetic: 10 to 13 litres of alcohol per t of cane via molasses, divided by 240 litres of alcohol per t of molasses, gives 42 to 54 kg of molasses per t of cane (Indian ratios) [@FS-37]; x 13.3 Mt of cane = 0.55 to 0.72 Mt (our calculation). The ratio is Indian and general.
- **Locations and sites.** The roughly 25 sugar mills (C11) [@FS-34].
- **Current use and buyers.** MSG and yeast fermentation, alcohol and feed. Ajinomoto ferments cassava starch and cane molasses [@IND-09] and AB Mauri's La Nga plant, a joint venture with Sugar Corporation II, makes yeast and bakery ingredients [@IND-15] {VN-direct|Medium}; its feedstock is not stated. QNS plans a molasses ethanol plant at An Khe that could be expanded to about 25,000 t of ethanol a year (reported), using about 1,000 t of molasses a day, 30% food grade and 70% fuel, and was tendering for partners in July 2026 [@IND-22] {VN-direct|Low}. A company plan reported by Bao Chinh phu gives 200 m3 a day for Q1 2028 [@FS-09], which does not match 25,000 t a year (200 m3 a day is about 73,000 m3 a year, our calculation), and a 2024 article gave 60 million litres a year for 2026 [@FS-35]; this is probably the same project, delayed {VN-direct|Medium}. If 1,000 t a day ran for a full year it would use about 0.37 Mt, about half of our national estimate (our calculation), so the plant would compete directly with MSG and yeast makers for molasses.
- **Prices.** Only a retail price for 35 kg cans: about 9,970 VND/kg (December 2023) [@FS-36] {VN-direct|Low}. No bulk mill-gate price was found. Vedan reported that molasses was tight in H1 2026 [@VCO-02] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Composition.** Not found for Vietnamese molasses.
- **Seasonality and storage.** Produced from November to June; stores in tanks.
- **Competing uses.** MSG, yeast, alcohol and ethanol, feed.
- **What it could become.** Carbon for yeast or fungal biomass (baker's yeast is already made in Vietnam, at La Nga; its feedstock was not confirmed); after ethanol, vinasse (C14).
- **Evidence gaps.** Measured volume, flows between mills and fermenters, bulk price, composition. An earlier lead said Vietnam was a net molasses importer in 2022; we did not verify it.
- **Sources.** [@FS-09; @FS-35; @FS-36; @FS-37; @IND-09; @IND-15; @IND-22; @VCO-02]

### C13. Bagasse (*bã mía*)

- **Volume.** Not established.
- **Current use.** Burned for power at the mills (not sourced). QNS plans to expand its An Khe biomass power plant to 135 MW [@FS-35] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Competing uses.** Mill power and heat, which makes bagasse largely committed.
- **What it could become.** Lignocellulosic carbon after pretreatment; not a near-term protein feedstock.
- **Evidence gaps.** Volume, surplus above mill energy needs.
- **Sources.** [@FS-35]

### C14. Vinasse (stillage from molasses ethanol)

- **Volume.** Not established. Vinasse will grow if the QNS An Khe molasses ethanol plant is built (C12).
- **What it could become.** Filamentous-fungus biomass. In flasks of diluted molasses vinasse, *Aspergillus oryzae* biomass had 44.7% CP, *Neurospora intermedia* 57.6% and *Rhizopus oryzae* 50.9% (N x 6.25). *Fusarium venenatum* and *Monascus purpureus* did not grow [@SCI-18] {general|High}.

> **Correction.** Karimi et al. (2019) report "118.5 g/L" of *A. oryzae* biomass on vinasse. This is not a broth concentration. The flask held 100 mL of 5% vinasse with about 21 g/L COD, and 11.85 g of dry biomass cannot come from 2.1 g of COD. The figure is most plausibly per litre of undiluted vinasse, about 5.9 g/L in the flask [@SCI-18]. Do not use it as a titre.

- **Evidence gaps.** Everything: volume, composition, disposal.

### C15. Surplus sugar

- **Volume.** 1.298 Mt of sugar in 2025/26 [@FS-31] {VN-direct|High}. HFCS imports were 111,839 t in H1 2026 [@FS-31] {VN-direct|Medium}. The GFI APAC and Hawkwood study used 2024 inputs of 1,350 kt produced, 110 kt imported and nothing exported, and scored Vietnam 26 of 100 on "sugar capability" [@RGN-01] {VN-direct|Medium}; we did not cross-check these inputs against USDA.
- **Prices.** The average domestic sugar price was about 16,505 VND/kg in June 2026 (refined sugar 16,900 to 17,200), a three-year low, against 19,646 to 27,315 VND/kg in China, Indonesia and the Philippines [@FS-31; @FS-33] {VN-direct|Medium}. That is about USD 635/t (our calculation, 16,505 x 1,000 / 26,000). World raw sugar was USD 330/t in March 2026 [@COST-32] and USD 380/t in August 2026 [@FM-01] {general|High}. The domestic average price is about 1.7 times the world raw-sugar price (our calculation, 635 / 380). Refined and raw sugar are different products, so this shows only that Vietnamese sugar is cheap against regional retail prices, not against the world raw-sugar market.
- **Competing uses.** Food and beverage; ethanol.
- **What it could become.** A clean, food-grade carbon source and the benchmark against which residues should be judged. Tax note: Decree 320/2025 gives the corporate income tax exemption for processed farm products only when agricultural raw materials are at least 30% of production cost. A plant on domestic cassava probably passes; a plant on imported refined sugar may not (our interpretation) [@REG2-18] {VN-direct|Medium}.

## Brewing

### C16. Brewer's spent grain (*bã bia*)

- **Volume.** At most 0.80 to 0.88 Mt wet a year, derived {VN-adjacent|Low}. Arithmetic: 4.0 to 4.4 billion litres of beer x 20 kg of wet spent grain per 100 litres [@FS-38; @FS-39] = 0.80 to 0.88 Mt wet; at about 80% moisture (our assumption), 160 to 176 kt DM; at about 20% protein in DM, 32 to 35 kt of protein (our calculation). Beer volume: more than 4 billion litres a year (VIRAC, 2022, cited in [@FS-40]) and 4.4 billion litres in 2019 [@FS-41] {VN-direct|Low}; consumption of about 3.8 billion litres in 2022 [@IND-24] {VN-direct|Medium}, which would give about 0.76 Mt wet (our calculation). No 2024 or 2025 beer volume was found. Treat the range as an upper bound: Vietnamese mass-market lagers use rice adjunct, which lowers the malt grist and so the spent grain per litre. The adjunct share was not found.
- **Locations.** Brewery sites in Ho Chi Minh City (including former Ba Ria-Vung Tau), Hanoi, Hue, Da Nang, Dong Thap (former Tien Giang), Can Tho (former Hau Giang) and the north ([[app-s5-facilities]]).
- **Sites and companies.** Market shares in 2023: Heineken 43%, Sabeco 33.9%, Carlsberg 9.2%, Habeco 7.5%, others 6.4% [@FS-41; @IND-23] {VN-direct|Medium}. There were 98 active breweries, most of them microbreweries (about 2020, secondary source) [@FS-41] {VN-direct|Low}. Sabeco has 26 breweries with 2.4 billion litres a year of design capacity at about 60% use (2024) [@IND-23] {VN-direct|Medium}. Heineken's HCMC (former Ba Ria-Vung Tau) brewery has 1.1 billion litres a year, with expansion to 1.6 billion approved in 2024 [@IND-26] {VN-direct|Medium}. A buyer deals with a handful of counterparties.
- **Current use and buyers.** Cattle and pig farms and feed traders [@FS-42] {VN-direct|Low}. Insect farming: Entobel's plant-opening release (November 2023) said it uses Heineken Vietnam by-products as feedstock [@ECO-01] {VN-direct|Low}; its current website does not mention feedstock [@FS-43]. Treat this as a company claim.
- **Prices.** One Hanoi retailer quotes 6,000 to 6,500 VND/kg fresh and about 5,500 VND/kg dried (March 2026) [@FS-42] {VN-direct|Low}. On a DM basis the fresh price is about 30,000 VND per kg of DM (our calculation, 6,000 / 0.2), four times dry rice bran at 7,300 to 7,650 VND/kg [@FS-26]. Treat it as a small-lot retail price, not a brewery gate price.
- **Composition.** About 20% protein and about 70% fibre, basis not stated [@FS-38] {general|Medium}. We found no source for the moisture; the 80% used above is our assumption. Lao brewers' grains: 24.3% DM and 24.8% CP in DM [@FS-19] {VN-adjacent|Medium}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** Year-round (not sourced). Fresh spent grain must be used within 2 to 3 days or ensiled with salt [@FS-42] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Competing uses.** Livestock farms and insect producers.
- **What it could become.** Protein and fibre fractions; a solid-state fermentation substrate. Insect feed is a current competing use; insect protein is a benchmark in this study, not a play. The volume and the short shelf life suit one plant next to one brewery, not a national play.
- **Evidence gaps.** Beer volume for 2024 and 2025 (NSO industrial output); brewery gate prices and tender terms; rice-adjunct share; Entobel's actual feedstock.
- **Sources.** [@ECO-01; @FS-19; @FS-26; @FS-38; @FS-39; @FS-40; @FS-41; @FS-42; @FS-43; @IND-23; @IND-24; @IND-26]

### C17. Brewer's spent yeast (*bã men bia*)

- **Volume.** Not established.
- **Research in Vietnam.** A University of Danang group removed tannins and debittered spent brewer's yeast with Tween 80 for yeast-extract use [@FS-40] {VN-direct|Medium}. HUST recovered 84.9% of spent-yeast protein and made a 14.9 g-protein energy bar (2024) [@RD-32] {VN-direct|High}. A 2018 study (affiliation not confirmed) reduced nucleic acid in spent-yeast hydrolysate [@RD-31] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Feed evidence (context).** Spent brewer's yeast replaced up to 60% of fishmeal protein in giant freshwater prawn diets without loss of growth or survival (Vietnam, 2019) [@RD-48] {VN-direct|High}. Brewer's yeast replaced 45% of fishmeal in hybrid "Thai Panga" catfish with better growth (review citation) [@SCI-26] {VN-adjacent|Medium}.
- **Rules.** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is on the aquafeed list as a microorganism, but "yeast protein" is not a listed raw material [@REG2-01] {VN-direct|High}. See [[app-s9-regulation]].
- **What it could become.** Yeast extract and yeast protein for food. Functional feed ingredients (beta-glucan is a listed aquafeed bioactive [@REG2-01]) were play T2 (functional microbial feed ingredients), retired because feed is now context only.
- **Evidence gaps.** Volume per brewery; current buyers and price.
- **Sources.** [@FS-40; @RD-31; @RD-32; @RD-48; @REG2-01; @SCI-26]

## Soy and other crops

### C18. Soybeans (*đậu tương*, *đậu nành*)

- **Volume.** Vietnam grew 42 kt of soybeans in MY2024/25 (USDA official; USDA Post and NSO give 43 kt on 26,300 ha), with 41 kt forecast for MY2025/26 and 40 kt for MY2026/27, as farmers switch to fruit and vegetables [@FS-24] {VN-direct|High}. It imported 2.61 Mt in 2025 (Brazil 45.8%, United States 43.6%, Canada 7.3%), 98.4% of imports plus domestic output [@MAC-09; @MAC-04] {VN-direct|Medium}. Imports are forecast at 3.2 Mt (MY2025/26) and 3.8 Mt (MY2026/27) [@FS-24] {VN-direct|Medium}. The domestic crush was 1.9 Mt in 2025 and is forecast at 2.5 Mt (2026) and 3.0 Mt (2027); 1.9 Mt of beans gave 1.48 Mt of meal at 78% extraction [@MAC-04] {VN-direct|Medium}. Vietnam also imported 5.70 Mt of soybean meal and fed 7.2 Mt in 2025, so about 99% of the soy protein in its feed is imported (our calculation: 5.70 Mt of imported meal plus about 1.45 Mt of meal from imported beans, of 7.2 Mt) [@MAC-04; @MAC-09] {VN-direct|Medium}. Food use was 540 kt in 2025 [@MAC-04] and is forecast at 550 kt (MY2025/26) and 570 kt (MY2026/27) [@FS-24] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Sites and companies.** A leading crusher is VAL (Bunge and Wilmar) at Phu My 1 Industrial Park, Ho Chi Minh City (former Ba Ria-Vung Tau): 2.6 Mt of soybeans a year and nearly 2 Mt of meal after a USD 100 M second line (December 2025) [@VCO-16] {VN-direct|Medium}. See [[app-s5-facilities]].
- **Prices.** US soybeans CIF Rotterdam USD 473/t (March 2026) [@COST-31] and USD 482/t (August 2026, World Bank) [@FM-01] {general|High}. Vietnam's average import price was USD 465.5/t in 2025 [@MAC-09] {VN-direct|High}. Dried soybean residue (okara, not soybean meal) sold at 9,000 to 11,000 VND/kg on a 2025 cattle-feed reference list [@FS-30] {VN-direct|Low}. We found no domestic soybean meal price.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said soybean meal sold at 9,000 to 11,000 VND/kg on a July 2026 list; the source lists dried soybean residue (okara) at that price, on a 2025 list.

- **What it could become.** Soy is already the base of tofu, soymilk and imported textured soy protein. We found no soy protein isolate or concentrate plant in Vietnam ([[app-s5-facilities]]).
- **Sources.** [@COST-31; @FM-01; @FS-24; @FS-30; @MAC-04; @MAC-09; @VCO-16]

### C19. Okara (*bã đậu nành*: tofu and soymilk residue)

- **Volume.** At most 605 to 660 kt wet a year (about 120 to 130 kt DM), derived {VN-adjacent|Low}. Arithmetic: 550 kt of food soy [@FS-24] x 1.1 to 1.2 kg of wet okara per kg of dry soybean [@FS-44; @FS-45] = 605 to 660 kt (our calculation); at about 80% moisture, 120 to 130 kt DM; at 25.4 to 28.4% protein in DM [@FS-45], about 30 to 37 kt of protein (our calculation). It is an upper bound because not all food soy goes to tofu or soymilk (sprouts, sauces and roasted soy also use it).
- **Locations.** Tofu villages and soymilk plants nationwide.
- **Sites and companies.** Vinasoy (QNS), with 390 million litres a year of soymilk capacity in three plants (2022) [@IND-49; @IND-50] {VN-direct|Medium}; ToFu House (Hung Yen), 150 to 500 t of tofu products a month [@IND-51] {VN-direct|Low}; Vinamilk and other dairy firms with plant-milk lines; thousands of small tofu makers.
- **Current use and buyers.** Pig, cattle and fish feed, or discarded. Dried okara sold at 9,000 to 11,000 VND/kg on a 2025 cattle-feed reference list [@FS-30] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Composition.** Moisture about 70 to 84%; protein about 15 to 40% of DM [@FS-44] {general|Medium}.
- **Seasonality and storage.** Year-round; spoils quickly unless dried.
- **What it could become.** A solid-state fermentation substrate (oyster-mushroom mycelium on cassava plus okara, preprint) [@RD-29]; a protein and fibre ingredient if dried. Soy-processing wastewater is a separate lead; the evidence we found is a feed trial, kept as context: a mixed-culture microbial protein grown on food-processing wastewater replaced up to 90% of fishmeal in whiteleg shrimp while maintaining specific growth rate and survival (preprint) [@SCI-25] {general|Low}.
- **Evidence gaps.** Okara volume at Vinasoy and the dairy majors; Vietnamese composition data; drying cost.
- **Sources.** [@FS-24; @FS-30; @FS-44; @FS-45; @IND-49; @IND-50; @IND-51; @RD-29; @SCI-25]

### C20. Mung bean (*đậu xanh*)

- **Volume.** Not established; not researched on the open web.
- **Protein quality.** Cooked mung bean scored a pig DIAAS of 86 (older child and adult pattern) and 68 (young-child pattern) [@SCI-41] {general|High}. In Indian children, true ileal digestibility of mung bean was 65.2%, about 20% lower than pig estimates [@SCI-42] {general|High}. Prefer human data for food claims.
- **Research in Vietnam.** Replacing 10 to 15% of meat with germinated mung bean flour was accepted in sausage [@RD-26] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **What it could become.** A local legume for hybrid and plant-based products; protein isolate (not studied in Vietnam).
- **Sources.** [@RD-26; @SCI-41; @SCI-42]

### C21. Peanut (*lạc*, *đậu phộng*)

- **Volume.** 380 kt forecast for MY2025/26; only 35 kt is crushed, mostly by household pressing; retail peanut oil sells at USD 4 to 5 per litre [@FS-24] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Locations.** Not sourced.
- **What it could become.** Peanut meal is small, because so little is crushed [@FS-24]. Peanut protein has been studied only in small Vietnamese university papers, including a 2017 study that used peanut protein as a sausage binder [@HXE-02] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Sources.** [@FS-24; @HXE-02]

### C22. Coconut (*dừa*)

- **Volume.** 1.728 Mt (USDA unit) in MY2025/26; copra crush 31 kt; coconut-oil exports 10,000 t in the first 7 months of MY2024/25 (up 68%); copra meal imports 70 kt [@FS-24] {VN-direct|Medium}. Copra meal imports were 53 kt in calendar 2025 [@MAC-04] {VN-direct|Medium}; the two figures refer to different periods.
- **Locations.** Vinh Long (former Ben Tre and Tra Vinh) is commonly cited as the main area; not verified.
- **What it could become.** Coconut water and paring residues as fermentation media; not quantified.
- **Sources.** [@FS-24; @MAC-04]

### C23. Cashew apple (*táo điều*)

- **Volume.** Not established. The cashew apple weighs 6 to 7 times the nut [@FS-47] {general|Low}. Only the domestic harvest counts, because imported raw nuts arrive without apples. Domestic raw-nut output was not verified.
- **Locations.** Dong Nai (former Binh Phuoc), Lam Dong (former Dak Nong and Binh Thuan) and Dak Lak are the usual growing areas; not sourced.
- **Current use.** Mostly left in the field.
- **What it could become.** A sugar-rich fermentation medium, if it can be collected; astringency and perishability are the barriers.
- **Sources.** [@FS-47]

### C24. Coffee pulp and husk (*vỏ cà phê*)

- **Volume.** The source states, without a reference, that Vietnam exports about 450 kt of dried coffee pulp a year; it gives 2016 coffee output as 1.64 Mt, and pulp is about 28% of dry berry weight [@FS-46] {VN-direct|Low}. Current coffee output was not verified.
- **Locations.** Dak Lak is named in the source; Lam Dong (former Dak Nong) and Gia Lai are regional knowledge.
- **Current use.** Fuel for coffee dryers and organic fertiliser [@FS-46] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Composition.** Caffeine 0.5 to 1.3%, which limits its use as feed [@FS-46] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Seasonality.** The coffee harvest runs from about October to January.
- **What it could become.** A decaffeinated fermentation substrate; the source paper optimises decaffeination.
- **Sources.** [@FS-46]

### C25. Jackfruit (*mít*)

- **Volume.** Not established; not researched.
- **Research in Vietnam.** We found no Vietnamese work on jackfruit-seed protein. The seed work we found is on starch [@RD-01] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **What it could become.** Young jackfruit as a whole-food meat analogue; seed protein. Both unstudied locally.
- **Sources.** [@RD-01]

## Aquatic and animal side streams

### C26. Seafood processing by-products (*phụ phẩm chế biến thủy sản*)

- **Output behind the stream (2025).** Aquaculture 6,116.8 kt (fish 4,035.0 kt, shrimp 1,381.7 kt); farmed pangasius 1,938.8 kt; whiteleg shrimp 994.4 kt; black tiger shrimp 296.7 kt; capture fisheries 3,830.7 kt [@MAC-15] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Pangasius.** Exporters such as Vietnam and Brazil use 3.1 kg of raw pangasius or tilapia per kg of fillet (a secondary citation in a Bangladeshi study), so about 68% of the fish is by-product (heads, frames, skin, viscera and belly fat; our calculation, 1 - 1 / 3.1) [@FS-48] {VN-adjacent|Low}. Another source gives 62 to 67% of the whole fish [@MAC-45] {VN-direct|Medium}. If all 1.94 Mt of farmed pangasius were filleted, by-products would be about 1.2 to 1.3 Mt a year (our calculation, 1,938.8 kt x 62 to 68%). Not all fish is filleted, so this is an upper bound.
- **Shrimp.** Side streams are about 45 to 50% of shrimp weight (35 to 56% depending on species) [@FS-49] {general|Medium}. If all 1.38 Mt of farmed shrimp were processed, side streams would be about 0.62 to 0.69 Mt a year (our calculation, 1,381.7 kt x 45 to 50%); again an upper bound.
- **Composition.** Shrimp head: up to 65% protein, 21% ash and 18% chitin in DM. Seafood discards average 60% protein, 19% fat and 22% ash in DM [@FS-50] {general|Medium}. Fishmeal yield from processing waste: 35.8% for African catfish waste and 54.8% for tilapia waste [@FM-44] {general|Medium}.
- **Locations.** Pangasius processors in Can Tho, Dong Thap, An Giang and Vinh Long; shrimp processors in Ca Mau, Can Tho (former Soc Trang) and Khanh Hoa. The list is regional knowledge.
- **Sites and companies.** Pangasius and shrimp processors such as Vinh Hoan; see [[app-s1-directory]].
- **Current use and buyers.** Fishmeal, fish oil, pangasius collagen and gelatin, shrimp-head meal and chitin. These uses come from earlier leads and were not re-verified. Vietnam exported USD 430.5 M of fishmeal in 2023, 93.5% of it to China, and imported USD 260 M [@FM-37; @FM-38] {VN-direct|Medium}, so much of the by-product meal leaves the country ([[app-s6-feed-market]]).
- **Prices.** Not found.
- **What it could become.** Protein hydrolysates (Tra catfish by-product hydrolysate has been tested as a fishmeal replacer in pig diets) [@MAC-45] {VN-direct|Medium}. These streams are animal-origin protein: benchmarks and competitors for alternative protein, not alternative-protein feedstocks.
- **Evidence gaps.** Measured by-product volumes; fishmeal plant list and capacity; prices by grade.
- **Sources.** [@FM-37; @FM-38; @FM-44; @FS-48; @FS-49; @FS-50; @MAC-15; @MAC-45]

### C27. Aquaculture effluent

- **Volume.** Not established. Pangasius pond area and nutrient loads were not found.
- **Research in Vietnam.** Duckweed removed nutrients from anaerobically treated swine wastewater in lab-scale stabilisation ponds in Vietnam [@RD-45] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **What it could become.** A growth medium for duckweed (C30) or microalgae (C29). Version 0.7 assessed this as a feed route (play T6, duckweed on aquaculture effluent for feed); the play was retired because feed is now context only. For food, the EU record on duckweed shows that mineral control and controlled water are the gate [@SCI-28; @SCI-30] {general|High}.
- **Sources.** [@RD-45; @SCI-28; @SCI-30]

## Novel biomass

### C28. Seaweed (*rong biển*)

- **Volume.** Not established. A national seaweed development scheme to 2030 is a lead we did not verify.
- **Species and locations.** Vietnam has 827 recorded seaweed species. The economically important, cultivated or harvested genera are *Caulerpa* (sea grapes, *rong nho*), *Sargassum* (*rong mơ*), *Gracilaria* (*rong câu*), *Ulva* and *Kappaphycus* (*rong sụn*); the study's samples came from Khanh Hoa (former Khanh Hoa and Ninh Thuan) [@FS-51] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Current use.** Carrageenan (*Kappaphycus*), agar (*Gracilaria*), food (*Caulerpa*) and wild *Sargassum* harvest.
- **Research in Vietnam.** Green seaweed (*Cladophora*) protein partly replaced fishmeal in black tiger shrimp postlarvae [@RD-50]; gut weed (*Ulva intestinalis*) meal was tested as dietary protein for the same species [@RD-51] {VN-direct|Medium}. A Wageningen study examined seaweed cultivation in Vietnam for livestock methane reduction [@RD-57] {VN-direct|Medium}. We found no work on food protein extraction.
- **Evidence gaps.** Production by species and province; farm-gate prices; protein content of Vietnamese material.
- **Sources.** [@FS-51; @RD-50; @RD-51; @RD-57]

### C29. Spirulina and microalgae (*tảo xoắn*, *vi tảo*)

- **Volume.** Not established. An earlier lead named Vinh Hao (Lam Dong, former Binh Thuan) as a spirulina producer; we did not verify it.
- **Research in Vietnam.** A 2021 review describes Arthrospira production in Vietnam [@RD-20] {VN-direct|Medium}. A salt-tolerant Spirulina strain reached 48.73% protein (dry weight) in a 42 ppt medium [@RD-21] {VN-direct|Medium}. Two Vietnamese microalgal isolates were characterised for food, feed and biodiesel [@RD-62] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Sites and companies.** Daesang Vietnam lists DHA biomass and *Chlorella* among its feed products, but does not say whether they are made in Vietnam [@IND-12] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Protein quality.** No DIAAS for microalgal biomass was available as of a 2021 review [@SCI-39] {general|Medium}.
- **Rules.** Microalgae are not on the aquafeed permitted list [@REG2-01] {VN-direct|High}.
- **What it could become.** A protein ingredient from salt-tolerant Spirulina grown on seawater or brackish water on the south-central coast. Microalgae grown on effluent for feed are context only.
- **Sources.** [@IND-12; @RD-20; @RD-21; @RD-62; @REG2-01; @SCI-39]

### C30. Duckweed and Wolffia (*bèo tấm*, *bèo trứng*, *rau bèo*)

- **Volume.** Not established. We found no evidence of commercial cultivation in Vietnam, only feed trials. One South Vietnam poultry trial replaced 7% of the diet with *Lemna minor* [@FS-54] {VN-adjacent|Low}.
- **Research in Vietnam.** More than 100 wild *Spirodela*, *Lemna* and *Wolffia* samples were collected nationwide and are held in a laboratory (2022) [@RD-44] {VN-direct|Medium}. A team at IPK Gatersleben with a Vietnamese first author and German and Czech groups assembled the *Spirodela intermedia* genome (2020) [@RD-71] {VN-direct|High}. We found no protein extraction, food trial or aquafeed trial with Vietnamese duckweed from 2015 to 2026 [@RD-01] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Composition.** *Wolffia* protein is 20 to 30% of freeze-dried weight in 11 lab-grown species [@SCI-34] {general|High}. Thai *Wolffia* had 44% CP, *Lemna* 22% and *Spirodela* 18%; in vitro standardised ileal protein digestibility was 72% (*Lemna*) and 69% (*Wolffia*) [@SCI-35] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. Drum-dried *Wolffia* had 32 to 34% protein and about 85% in vitro digestibility (81% fresh) [@SCI-48] {VN-adjacent|Medium}. Manganese in *Wolffia* is 78 to 431 mg/kg of dry weight [@SCI-34] {general|High}.
- **Productivity.** About 30 t per ha a year (basis not stated) is the average in a 2026 review, which also cites 33 t DM per ha over 8 months on domestic wastewater [@SCI-36]. Another review gives up to 100 t DM per ha a year [@SCI-37] {general|Medium}; we treat this as a ceiling (our judgement). We use 10 to 30 t DM per ha a year for planning until Vietnamese field trials exist.

> **Correction.** EFSA (2021) could not establish the safety of whole *Wolffia globosa* powder or of mixed water-lentil powder, because of manganese intake. It found a *Lemna* protein concentrate safe (2023) [@SCI-28; @SCI-29; @SCI-30]. The "PDCAAS 0.89" figure in earlier drafts applies only to *W. globosa* powder: it comes from an unpublished applicant rat study reported by EFSA (2021) [@SCI-28] and repeated in a 2026 review [@SCI-31]. Do not apply it to duckweed generally. The same review says *Wolffia* powder was later authorised in the EU (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2223) and that the Thai FDA treats it as traditional food [@SCI-31]; we did not read the regulation itself.

- **What it could become.** A food protein concentrate grown in controlled water with mineral limits. *Wolffia* is sold as food in Thailand and elsewhere [@FS-54]. Feed protein grown on aquaculture or livestock effluent is context only: the version 0.7 play on aquaculture effluent (T6) is retired.
- **Sources.** [@FS-54; @RD-01; @RD-44; @RD-71; @SCI-28; @SCI-29; @SCI-30; @SCI-31; @SCI-34; @SCI-35; @SCI-36; @SCI-37; @SCI-48]

### C31. Mushrooms and spent mushroom substrate (*bã nấm*, *phôi nấm*)

- **Volume.** National mushroom output was not verified. The general ratio is about 3 kg of spent substrate per kg of mushrooms [@FS-55] {general|Low}.
- **Substrates.** Rice straw for straw mushroom; sawdust for oyster mushrooms. A Vietnamese trial (Luu et al. 2022, cited in [@FS-55]) reused spent oyster-mushroom sawdust to grow straw mushroom {VN-adjacent|Low}.
- **Research in Vietnam.** Grey oyster mushroom on cassava peel from starch production [@RD-64]; oyster-mushroom mycelium in solid-state fermentation of cassava and okara (C19) [@RD-29] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **What it could become.** Mycelium protein by solid-state fermentation of local residues; spent substrate as feed or compost.
- **Sources.** [@FS-55; @RD-29; @RD-64]

## Industrial co-products

### C32. Ethanol stillage and distillers' grains (*bã rượu*, DDG)

- **Plants.** Three fuel-ethanol plants run, with a combined design capacity of 830 m3 a day: Dung Quat (Quang Ngai) 330 m3, the Quang Nam plant (now Da Nang) 300 m3 and Dong Nai 200 m3. Their June 2026 output was 20,875 m3 [@FS-09] {VN-direct|High}. At full design capacity that is about 277,000 to 303,000 m3 a year at 334 to 365 operating days (our calculation from [@FS-09]). National design capacity across six or seven plants is about 480,000 to 490,000 m3 a year [@IND-18; @IND-20]; another source gives 450,000 [@IND-19] {VN-direct|Medium}. Dung Quat is switching its feedstock from cassava to corn in Q3 2026 [@FS-09] {VN-direct|High}, which could create a DDGS-like co-product. See [[app-s5-facilities]].
- **Volume.** Stillage and distillers' grains volumes are not published.
- **Composition.** Rice-based dried distillers' grains from Vietnamese ethanol production hold 50 to 80% protein on a DM basis; cassava DDG holds only 13 to 16% (preprint, 2024) [@RD-22] {VN-direct|Medium}. Alkaline extraction recovered 90% of rice-DDG protein, and enzyme-extracted protein was 77.1% digestible in vitro (HUST, 2025) [@RD-23] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Reference: imported DDGS.** Vietnam imported 1.55 Mt of DDGS in 2025 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}, mainly from the United States.
- **What it could become.** Food protein from rice DDG, where extraction is published but texturisation is not. A DDGS-like feed co-product from the corn switch would be context, not a target.
- **Evidence gaps.** Stillage volume per plant; rice-liquor DDG volume; whether Dung Quat will dry its stillage.

### C33. MSG and amino-acid fermentation co-products

- **Ajinomoto (Bien Hoa, Dong Nai).** The MSG plant has production lines for liquid and solid feed raw materials and fertiliser. A December 2023 environmental consultation gives 30,000 m3 a year of liquid feed ingredients (proposed 50,000) and 5,000 t a year of solid (proposed 10,000) [@IND-08] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Vedan (Phuoc Thai, Dong Nai).** Vedan sells condensed molasses fermentation solubles (CMS), polyglutamic acid (PGA) broth, fertiliser, and CMS liquid and granule feed products [@IND-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. Its "fertiliser and feed" segment earned USD 27.1 M in 2025, 7.2% of group revenue [@VCO-01], and 6.5% of revenue in H1 2026 [@VCO-02] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Daesang (Phu Tho).** Lists L-lysine, L-arginine, L-histidine, DHA biomass and *Chlorella* among its feed products; whether they are made in Vietnam is not stated [@IND-12] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **The import counterfactual.** A Chinese single-cell biomass left over from glutamic acid fermentation, with at least 70% CP, more than 85% digestible protein and no more than 7% ash, is imported and sold in Vietnam as "Mycoprotein" by CK Vietnam / V-Group [@FM-12; @ECO-69] {VN-direct|Medium}. It shows that an MSG plant can yield a feed protein. We did not find whether Vedan or Ajinomoto produce or sell a similar biomass.
- **What it could become.** A domestic single-cell protein side stream, if the incumbents separate and dry their bacterial biomass. Version 0.7 assessed it as feed; [[app-s6-feed-market]] keeps that record and the feed prices it would face. Feed is now context only.
- **Evidence gaps.** Product sheets and prices for Vedan CMS and pellets and for Ajinomoto's feed ingredients; whether bacterial cell mass is recovered.
- **Sources.** [@ECO-69; @FM-12; @IND-01; @IND-08; @IND-12; @VCO-01; @VCO-02]

### C34. Reference streams: maize and imported feed ingredients

These streams are context. They are the feed behind the meat, eggs and farmed fish that people in Vietnam eat, and most of it is imported.

- **Maize.** 4.4 Mt in 2025 (NSO) [@FS-25] or 4.1 Mt on 810,000 ha in MY2025/26 (USDA), falling to 4.0 Mt in MY2026/27 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|Medium}. About 1.7 Mt of local corn went into compound feed in 2025 [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}. Ground corn sold at 6,000 to 8,000 VND/kg on a 2025 cattle-feed reference list [@FS-30] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **The feed-ingredient balance.** USDA's 2025 feed-ingredient table shows 23.57 Mt imported out of 28.62 Mt, about 82%. Domestic supply was 5.05 Mt: rice bran and broken rice 2.8 Mt, corn 1.7 Mt and cassava 0.55 Mt. Imports included 9.2 Mt of corn, 7.2 Mt of soybean meal (counting local crush of imported beans), 1.55 Mt of DDGS and 2.58 Mt of feed wheat [@FS-23] {VN-direct|High}. See [[app-s6-feed-market]].

## Gaps and how to close them

| # | Gap | Why it matters | Cheapest way to close it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cassava pulp gate price, and the split between wet sale, drying, biogas and dumping | Sets the carbon cost of the largest residue | Call 3 to 5 Tay Ninh factories (for example Dinh Khue, Hung Duy Group) and the Son La Starch Factory; read the Vietnam Cassava Association weekly bulletins in a browser |
| 2 | A Vietnamese pulp material balance (wet and DM per t of roots) | Our 6 Mt rests on a Thai ratio | Sample 10 or more factories across a season; a small university project |
| 3 | National starch output including domestic use | Pulp scales with starch, not exports | MOIT industrial statistics; NSO main industrial products tables; Vietnam Cassava Association |
| 4 | Beer volume for 2024 and 2025, rice-adjunct share, brewery gate prices for spent grain | Spent-grain volume is an upper bound | NSO output of "bia các loại"; Vietnam Beer-Alcohol-Beverage Association; Heineken and Sabeco sustainability reports; ask Entobel about its feedstock |
| 5 | Molasses volume, flows and bulk price | Molasses is a contested fermentation carbon | Vietnam Sugarcane and Sugar Association; TTC AgriS and QNS annual reports; buyers (Vedan, Ajinomoto) |
| 6 | Broken-rice volume and uses | A clean food-grade carbon at near-rice price | Vietnam Food Association |
| 7 | Seafood by-product volumes and fishmeal plants | Sets the domestic animal-protein competitor | VASEP; Vinh Hoan and other pangasius exporters' annual reports; MAE fisheries department |
| 8 | Seaweed, spirulina and mushroom output | Cannot size novel biomass today | MAE fisheries and crop production departments; the seaweed development scheme text on thuvienphapluat.vn; Vinh Hao Mineral Water Company |
| 9 | Duckweed and Wolffia: productivity and minerals on Mekong water | Food route depends on manganese control | Can Tho University and Nong Lam University; field plots with mineral profiling |
| 10 | Coffee and cashew output | Only 2016-basis coffee pulp figure | USDA Coffee Annual; VICOFA (the coffee and cocoa association); VINACAS (the cashew association) |
| 11 | Soybean crushers and okara volumes | Okara is the only local plant-protein residue of note | Vietnam Feed Association; Vinasoy; the QNS annual report |
| 12 | Biogas, natural gas and CO2 sources for gas fermentation | Methane and CO2 routes are unmapped | PV Gas; BSR (Dung Quat CO2 capture); starch-factory biogas surveys |
| 13 | Ethanol stillage and DDG volumes; Dung Quat after the corn switch | Rice DDG is a possible food protein; a corn feed co-product is context | Ask BSR and the Dong Nai and Da Nang plants directly |
| 14 | MSG plant biomass co-products | A possible domestic SCP side stream | Vedan and Ajinomoto product sheets and a direct inquiry |
| 15 | A national by-product return | Nobody publishes starch, pulp, spent grain, okara, molasses or seafood by-product volumes | A one-page annual return for starch factories, breweries, sugar mills and seafood processors through MAE or provincial Departments of Agriculture and Environment |

See [[app-r1-open-questions]] for the full register and [[app-r2-disagreements]] for the conflicting figures (starch factory count, pulp ratios, chip exports, spent-grain price).
