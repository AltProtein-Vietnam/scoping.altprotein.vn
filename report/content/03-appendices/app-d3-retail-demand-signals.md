# D3. The retail audit re-read for demand

**What this appendix contains.** The September 2026 retail audit ([[app-s2-retail-audit]]) logged 186 products in 11 stores in Nha Trang (6 September) and Ho Chi Minh City (16 and 20 September) to study formulation. Here we re-read the same records for demand signals. Eight stores are mass modern retail (Lotte Mart, Co.opmart, GO!, WinMart, Emart) and three are premium or import-led (Annam Gourmet, Nam An Market, Moonmilk). The audit is a convenience sample of modern and premium stores, with no wet markets, chay shops, online-only brands or foodservice, so these are signals about the shelf, not measures of the market [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}. The first sales counters: 96 listings read on two online marketplaces and 185 on a kitchen supply platform and two specialist shops (section D3.3).

## D3.1 Six signals

1. **Two shelves, two markets.** Imported finished products are 2.9% of the 140 products logged in mass stores and 67% of the 46 in premium stores. Imported frozen meat analogues appeared only in premium stores in Ho Chi Minh City; Nha Trang had none [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}. Modern plant-based products are an import-led premium niche; the mass shelf is Vietnamese chay, tofu and plant milk.
2. **Price points are low.** In mass stores the median pack costs VND 12,650 for tofu, VND 27,500 for plant milk, VND 45,500 for a frozen chay wrapper pack and VND 71,500 for a frozen chay meat analogue; in premium stores a frozen analogue pack costs a median VND 179,000 and a plant milk VND 94,900 [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}. For comparison, average household food and drink spending is about VND 43,700 per person per day (VND 1,310,000 a month in 2024, our division) [@DIE-05] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:inferred}.
3. **Twenty grams of protein costs more than a meal.** The median cost of 20 g of protein is about VND 13,000 from tofu or dried textured soy, VND 56,000 from a frozen meat analogue, VND 60,000 from a ready meal, VND 74,000 from a filled chay wrapper and VND 91,000 from plant milk (our calculation on label protein). From eggs or chicken it is VND 7,000 to 9,000 and from lean pork about VND 14,000 ([[ch11-protein-diet]]). A street rice plate with meat costs VND 30,000 to 35,000 in Ho Chi Minh City [@FORM-01; @CHY-40] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:inferred}.
4. **Protein is not sold, though much of the shelf could claim it.** Only two locally made products carry a protein claim in their name, both variants of Vinamilk's high-protein nut milk (5 g per 100 ml); no chay food does. Protein values could be captured for only 44% of mass-store products and 35% of premium-store products, a gap in capture as well as in labelling [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}. Protein has had to appear on non-exempt pre-packaged labels since 1 January 2026 (Circular 29/2023, now Circular 30/2026), so the gap is mostly in capture and in small makers, who are exempt [@LBL-01; @LBL-02] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}. Against the claim conditions of TCVN 14429:2025 (source 5 g, high 10 g per 100 g), 20 of 43 audited plant-protein foods with a label value (47%) already meet "source" and 7 (16%) meet "high", all seven frozen analogues; counting the per 100 kcal route, 27 of 38 and 13 of 38 do (our calculation; `protein_claim_eligibility.csv`) [@FORM-01; @LBL-03] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:revealed}. A numeric protein claim is an open position on the chay shelf, not a regulatory problem.
5. **Chay on the pack is a religious and culinary word, not a vegan standard.** *Chay* appears in 87 of 186 product names. Of 64 chay-named products with a logged ingredient list, at least 23 (36%) name onion, garlic, shallot or leek, which strict Buddhist cooking avoids, and at least 3 (5%) name egg or dairy in the ingredient list or a same-formulation label (our keyword search and label check, a lower bound) [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:inferred}. Mass-market chay follows lay practice; strict buyers need labelled variants.
6. **Plant milk spans a four-fold price ladder.** Mass soy milk sells at about VND 22,900 per litre, below cow milk; Vinamilk's high-protein nut milk at about VND 87,000; imported oat, almond and nut milks at a median VND 94,900 in premium stores [@FORM-01; @CON-35] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}. The mass price point, not the premium one, is where plant milk became Vietnam's modern plant-protein category at scale ([[ch13-consumers]]). If the sugary-drink excise reaches sweetened soy milk from 2027, mass soy milk would be about VND 25,200 per litre in 2028, still below cow milk (our calculation) [@FORM-01; @FTR-01; @FTR-18; @CON-35] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:inferred}.

Two rows of the table overstate what some buyers pay (these notes are not in `retail_demand_signals.csv`):

- **Dried textured soy (VND 12,900 per 20 g of protein, store packs).** Online, 1 kg bags of dry soy-and-gluten pieces cost VND 59,000 to 158,680 per kg, about VND 1,800 to 6,000 per 20 g of protein on a borrowed label range of 53.3 to 66.7 g per 100 g; a 150 g branded pack online costs VND 12,600 to 15,800 per 20 g, like the store median (our calculation) [@MKT-03; @FORM-01] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:inferred}. Bulk format, not the product, makes dried textured soy the cheapest protein in Vietnam's retail data.
- **Protein powder (VND 71,900 per 20 g, premium stores, n = 4).** At a sports-nutrition chain (WheyShop), whey costs VND 20,800 to 35,000 and plant powders VND 36,000 to 54,800 per 20 g of protein (5 products with protein facts), and plant powders are 2 of 25 protein powders listed [@ECR-08; @FORM-01] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}. On Lazada, seven plant powder listings show 7,294 sales against 5,455 for six whey listings, and the top plant listing, a Vietnamese-made pea and nut powder, costs about VND 14,600 per 20 g of protein, below imported whey (our calculation, `marketplace_sku_counters.csv`) [@MKT-03; @MKT-04; @ECR-08] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}. The premium-store median overstates what gym users pay.

## D3.3 Sales counters online and in kitchens

Shops in Vietnam show *đã bán* (units sold) counters. They are cumulative with no start date, so newer listings are understated, and rows come from the first page of targeted searches, so sums are orders of magnitude, not market shares. In a logged-out browser Lazada and Tiki show counters; Shopee requires a login and TikTok Shop a CAPTCHA, so those two, the largest platforms [@ECR-02], stay unread [@MKT-01; @MKT-02; @MKT-03; @MKT-05] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}. The kitchen counters come from Kamereo, a business-to-business platform supplying restaurants and cafés [@ECR-06] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}. Rows: `marketplace_sku_counters.csv` (96 listings, 25 September 2026) and `kitchen_platform_counters.csv` (185 listings, September 2026).

| Signal | Consumer marketplaces (Lazada, Tiki) | Kitchen platform (Kamereo) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plant milk against dairy | Best-selling plant milk SKU sells 60% (Lazada) and 79% (Tiki) of the litres of the best-selling dairy SKU | Plant milks about 4% of 899,000 milk litres and 1.5 to 2.1% of milk protein | [@MKT-03; @MKT-05; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Leading plant milk | Domestic nut milk (Lazada) and soy milk (Tiki); imported oat under 2% of plant-milk litres read | Imported Oatside oat milk, bought for coffee (36% of plant-milk litres) | [@MKT-03; @MKT-05; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| High-protein nut milk (Vinamilk, 5 g per 100 ml) | About 16,100 cases (about 70,300 L, 3.5 t of protein) at Vinamilk's Lazada store; about 11% of its nut-milk litres read but 29% of their protein; 24% dearer per litre, about 37% of the cost per gram of protein | Not listed | [@MKT-03; @MKT-04] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Protein-claimed soy milk (GoldSoy, 3.2 g per 100 ml) | 3,100 cases against 14,800 for an unclaimed walnut soy milk at 2.0 g in the same store, although GoldSoy is 39% cheaper per litre | 2,609 units against 5,758 and 5,828 for two dearer unclaimed soy milks | [@MKT-03; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Imported plant-based meat | None listed; searches for *thịt thực vật* (plant meat) and "meat zero" returned pork | Eight Meat Zero listings, 386 units (80 kg) in all, not orderable | [@MKT-03; @ECR-06; @AIS-25] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Dry chay soy-and-gluten pieces | About 40,700 kg dry on Lazada, 82% from one small shop; official stores under 1% of these sales | 240 kg | [@MKT-03; @MKT-04; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Frozen chay and chay *giò* (meat-style loaf) | Up to about 1,100 kg per listing; one chay *giò lụa* 11 packs; no chay listing carries a numeric protein claim | Vissan chay spring roll 0 units | [@MKT-03; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Fresh tofu | Not a marketplace product | About 80,800 kg across 32 listings | [@MKT-03; @MKT-05; @ECR-06] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |
| Who sells | Official or LazMall stores take 93 to 100% of milk units read but under 1% of dry chay piece sales | Platform-run | [@MKT-03; @MKT-05] {VN-direct\|Low} {dx:revealed} |

Three readings follow (our inference) {VN-direct|Low} {dx:inferred}. Plant milk is a mainstream household purchase online, sold through incumbents' official stores. Protein sells in that aisle only as a premium niche inside an incumbent's range, and a protein claim alone did not lift soy milk in either channel. And the chay product households buy online in bulk is the dry textured piece, an ingredient-like product made by small shops, which fits an ingredient route better than a branded analogue. A second read of the same listings a month later would turn the counters into monthly rates ([[ch13-consumers]], [[ch15-channels]]).

## D3.4 What a second audit round should add

- Wet markets, dedicated chay shops and pagoda-adjacent stalls, where most chay is bought.
- Meat equivalents with label protein for every chay product logged, so that price per gram of protein can be compared pair by pair.
- A repeat visit before and during the 7th lunar month, to measure the calendar spike on the shelf.
- Da Nang and Hanoi, to test the north and south difference in tofu and chay reported in [[ch11-protein-diet]] and [[ch12-chay-baseline]].
- Online small makers. Lazada and Tiki can be read in a logged-out browser (section D3.3), which partly closes the small-maker gap for dry chay goods on Lazada; Shopee needs a login and TikTok Shop a CAPTCHA, so reading them needs a person with an account or a paid report, and a repeat read of the same listings is needed to turn counters into rates [@MKT-01; @MKT-02; @MKT-03; @MKT-05] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}.
- The makers behind the online dry chay pieces (the one product page we opened names no maker; one listing name says its soy is imported and non-GM), a named buyer group for a domestic textured protein [@MKT-04] {VN-direct|Low} {dx:revealed}.
