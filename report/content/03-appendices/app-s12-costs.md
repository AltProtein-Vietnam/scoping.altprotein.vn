# S12. Cost inputs and techno-economic benchmarks

This appendix holds the numbers behind [[ch09-economics]]. It has four parts:

- **Part one:** Vietnamese input costs in 2026: electricity, water, heat, labour, land, taxes and logistics.
- **Part two:** commodity prices, the protein ingredients Vietnam imports, and the retail prices of the proteins an alternative would replace.
- **Part three:** published techno-economic analyses (TEAs), which are cost models of a process at a given scale. We checked each against the paper. This part also gives the spread in capital cost per m3 of reactor and what decides cost.
- **Part four:** our tropical cooling estimate and two indicative Vietnamese cost stacks, with the basis of every line.

The study now concentrates on protein for people, so it compares new protein with food comparators ([[ch09-economics]], section 9.3). Feed prices (fishmeal and soybean meal) and the fungal cost stack, which was built as a feed ingredient, stay here as context and as the record. More feed prices are in [[app-s6-feed-market]]; raw-material prices are in [[app-s4-feedstocks]].

## How to read this appendix

- **Currency.** We convert at 26,000 VND per USD. Vietcombank quoted 25,800 (buy) and 26,210 (sell) on 23 September 2026 [@COST-26] {VN-direct|High}. VND prices exclude VAT unless stated.
- **Three kinds of number.** "Measured" numbers come from a tariff, law, price report or paper. "Our calculation" numbers are arithmetic on measured inputs, and show the inputs. "Assumption" numbers are engineering judgements with no Vietnamese source. The cost stacks label every line.
- **TEA checks.** For each benchmark we say whether we read the full text, main excerpts or only the abstract. Only full-text or excerpt-checked values carry High confidence.
- **Indicative, not feasibility.** The cost stacks are order-of-magnitude estimates to show which lines matter. They are not a feasibility study.

## Part one. Vietnamese input costs

### S12.1 Electricity

**Manufacturing tariff** (VND/kWh, excluding VAT; Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) Decision 1279/QD-BCT of 9 May 2025, effective 10 May 2025) [@COST-01; @COST-02] {VN-direct|High}:

| Voltage | Off-peak | Normal | Peak | Blended 24/7 (our calculation) | USD/kWh |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 110 kV and above | 1,146 | 1,811 | 3,266 | 1,905 | 0.073 |
| 22 to under 110 kV | 1,190 | 1,833 | 3,398 | 1,952 | 0.075 |
| 6 to under 22 kV | 1,234 | 1,899 | 3,508 | 2,020 | 0.078 |
| Under 6 kV | 1,300 | 1,987 | 3,640 | 2,110 | 0.081 |

- **Time windows.** MOIT Decision 963 (2026), effective 22 April 2026, moved the peak to the evening: peak 17:30 to 22:30 Monday to Saturday (30 hours a week), off-peak 00:00 to 06:00 every day (42 hours), normal all other hours (96 hours) [@COST-03] {VN-direct|Medium}. We did not read the decision text directly.
- **Blended price for a plant that runs 24 hours a day** = (30 x peak + 42 x off-peak + 96 x normal) / 168 hours. Example at 22 kV: (30 x 3,398 + 42 x 1,190 + 96 x 1,833) / 168 = 327,888 / 168 = 1,952 VND/kWh, about USD 0.075 (our calculation). Mid-size plants in industrial parks commonly connect at 22 kV, so we use 1,952 VND/kWh as the base case for a continuous fermentation plant. It excludes VAT and any future capacity charge.
- **Business tariff.** If a pilot facility were classed as business rather than manufacturing, the under-6 kV tariff is 1,918 (off-peak), 3,152 (normal) and 5,422 (peak) VND/kWh [@COST-03] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Average retail price.** 2,204.0655 VND/kWh after a 4.8% rise on 10 May 2025. The press still quoted it in July 2026, so we found no increase between May 2025 and July 2026 [@COST-01; @COST-04] {VN-direct|High}.
- **More frequent adjustments.** Decree 278/2026/ND-CP (reported effective about 9 July 2026) lets EVN (Vietnam Electricity, the state utility) move the average price by 2% to under 5% after a MOIT review [@COST-04] {VN-direct|Medium}. We did not read the decree text.
- **Two-part tariff.** A pilot of a capacity-plus-energy tariff was planned from 1 January 2026 for customers using 200,000 kWh or more a month at 22 kV or above (Electricity Law 2024 Art 50; Decree 146/2025/ND-CP) [@COST-05] {VN-direct|Medium}. A consultancy reports parallel reference ("shadow") bills from 1 January 2026 and real two-part billing from 1 July 2026 [@COST-06] {VN-direct|Low}. We did not read the final MOIT decision. No VND/kW rates were published. A capacity charge from July 2026 could raise costs for plants with high peak demand.
- **Regional comparison.** The site-selection study by GFI APAC (the Asia-Pacific office of the Good Food Institute) and Hawkwood Biotech used USD 0.08/kWh for Vietnam and scored Vietnam 97 of 100 on utilities; Indonesia (USD 0.07/kWh) scored 99 [@RGN-01] {VN-direct|Medium}.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said large users receive only a reference ("shadow") bill for all of 2026; the sources say shadow bills ran in the first half of 2026 and real two-part billing was planned from 1 July 2026.

**Direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) save little.** A DPPA lets a large user buy power directly from a generator. On our calculation, the saving against our base case is only about 3%. The DPPA saving is modelled, single-source and could vanish under a capacity charge.

- **Models and threshold.** Decree 57/2025/ND-CP set two models: a private wire, and a synthetic DPPA over the national grid. Buyers qualify at an average of 200,000 kWh a month or more (Circular 16/2025/TT-BCT, as summarised by a consultancy) [@COST-06] {VN-direct|Medium}. A 10,000 t/yr fermentation plant using 1.5 to 3 kWh per kg would need about 1.25 to 2.5 GWh a month (our calculation), far above the threshold.
- **Price.** Under the synthetic model the buyer pays the spot price, plus an EVN DPPA service charge of about 420 VND/kWh (2025 reference), plus the contract-for-difference settlement, plus retail top-up power [@COST-06] {VN-direct|Low}. The consultancy's worked example gives about 1,895 VND/kWh (spot about 1,100, service charge about 420, settlement about 180, and 10% top-up at retail). That is about 11% below its EVN comparison of about 2,128 VND/kWh [@COST-06] {VN-direct|Low}.
- **Saving.** Against our 24/7 baseline of 1,952 VND/kWh, the saving is only about 3% (our calculation, 1 - 1,895 / 1,952). The consultancy probably assumed more peak-hour use.
- **Rule change in 2026.** Decree 243/2026/ND-CP (26 June 2026) amended Decree 57. It removed price caps on private-wire DPPA and widened participation to retailers, data centres and electric-vehicle charging operators [@COST-07] {VN-direct|Medium}.

**Grid emission factor.** The latest official figure, as of January 2026, is 0.6592 tCO2/MWh for 2023, announced on 3 December 2024 (Official Letter 1726/BDKH-PTCBT) [@COST-08; @COST-09] {VN-direct|High}. As of January 2026 there was no official 2024 or 2025 figure; researchers estimate 0.6811 (2024) and 0.6235 (2025) [@COST-09] {VN-direct|Medium}. At the official factor, a process that uses 2 kWh of grid power per kg of product emits about 1.3 kg of CO2 per kg from power alone (our calculation, 2 x 0.6592) [@COST-08]. For comparison, one TEA puts the carbon intensity of hydrogen-based single-cell protein (SCP, protein-rich biomass of bacteria, yeast or fungi) as low as 0.73 kg CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per kg of protein, against averages of 2.72 for fishmeal and 0.85 for soybean meal (abstract only) [@COST-45] {general|Medium}. A "low-carbon protein" claim for a power-hungry process in Vietnam needs a DPPA or on-site solar. The revised national power plan targets 28 to 36% non-hydro renewable generation by 2030 [@GT-11] {VN-direct|High}.

### S12.2 Water and wastewater

| Location (current name) | Production water price | Basis | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ho Chi Minh City (Ben Thanh Water area) | 12,100 VND/m3 base; 16,625 VND/m3 all-in (about USD 0.64), including 5% VAT, a 3,630 VND drainage and wastewater service charge and 8% tax on that service | 2026, unchanged from 2025 | [@COST-10] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Ho Chi Minh City (former Binh Duong), BIWASE | 13,800 VND/m3 retail for manufacturing; 13,100 wholesale to industrial parks | since 2022, excluding VAT | [@COST-12] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Hanoi | 16,000 VND/m3 for production (business services 29,000) | from 1 January 2024 (Decision 3541/QD-UBND) | [@COST-11] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Dong Nai (including former Binh Phuoc) | not found | n/a | none | {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Industrial parks (broker listings) | water about USD 0.5/m3; wastewater treatment USD 0.28/m3 (VSIP II) to USD 0.40/m3 (Nam Thang Long, Hanoi) | undated | [@COST-13; @COST-14] | {VN-direct\|Low} |

- Check: 12,100 x 1.05 + 3,630 x 1.08 = 12,705 + 3,920 = 16,625 VND/m3 (our calculation).
- Industrial parks set the wastewater charge as F = f x V x K, where K is a pollution coefficient based on chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measure of organic pollution. So spent fermentation broth may pay a multiple of the base fee, or need treatment on site first.
- Water is a minor cost in both cost stacks below.

### S12.3 Heat and fuel

- **Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).** A 48 kg industrial cylinder cost 2,212,000 VND in Ho Chi Minh City and 2,115,072 VND in Hanoi in September 2026, about 46,100 VND/kg (USD 1.77) in Ho Chi Minh City (our calculation). The Saudi contract price was USD 642.5/t, up from USD 630 in August [@COST-15] {VN-direct|Medium}. Bulk contracts are cheaper.
- **Biomass.** Rice husk pellets list at 2,190 VND/kg (unit inferred) with 3,200 to 3,900 kcal/kg; wood pellets 3,090 VND/kg; wood chips 1,290 VND/kg (supplier list, December 2025; sale prices, against list prices of 2,390, 3,490 and 1,490) [@COST-16] {VN-direct|Low}. Wood pellets exported at USD 120 to 145/t FOB (free on board, the price at the export port) in Q1 2025 [@COST-17] {VN-direct|Low}. Ajinomoto's Bien Hoa MSG plant burns nearly 100,000 t of rice husk a year (biomass boiler since 2014) [@IND-09] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Steam, fuel only (our calculation).** At 640 kcal per kg of steam, 3,200 to 3,900 kcal per kg of husk pellets and 75 to 85% boiler efficiency, one kg of steam needs 0.19 to 0.27 kg of pellets, or 420 to 585 VND of fuel [@COST-16]. A supplier claims a fuel cost of 830 to 870 VND per kg of steam, using wood pellets at 85 to 87% efficiency [@COST-17] {VN-direct|Low}. The gap is mainly the dearer wood-pellet fuel (our reading); operation, maintenance, capital and labour come on top of both. We found no published steam tariffs from industrial parks.
- **Natural gas and compressed natural gas (CNG).** Not published. Gas South prices industrial CNG per customer, indexed to fuel oil or LPG [@COST-18] {VN-direct|Low}.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said a 45 kg LPG cylinder cost about 49,000 VND/kg (USD 1.89) including VAT; the source prices a 48 kg cylinder, about 46,100 VND/kg (USD 1.77), and does not say VAT is included.

### S12.4 Labour

| Item | Value | Source | Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum wage from 1 January 2026, Region I | 5,310,000 VND/month (about USD 204); 25,500 VND/hour | [@COST-19] | {VN-direct\|High} |
| Region II | 4,730,000 VND/month; 22,700 VND/hour | [@COST-19] | {VN-direct\|High} |
| Region III | 4,140,000 VND/month; 20,000 VND/hour | [@COST-19] | {VN-direct\|High} |
| Region IV | 3,700,000 VND/month; 17,800 VND/hour | [@COST-19] | {VN-direct\|High} |
| Average monthly income of employees, Q2 2026 | 9.0 million VND (about USD 346), up 0.72 million year on year | [@COST-20] | {VN-direct\|High} |
| Manufacturing wage used by the GFI APAC and Hawkwood study | USD 342/month (labour score 100, shared with Indonesia at USD 350) | [@RGN-01] | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Employer contributions | 17.5% social insurance + 3% health + 1% unemployment + 2% trade-union fee = about 23.5% of insured salary (employee pays 10.5%) | not re-read in this study | {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Engineer, biotech and quality assurance (QA) salaries | not found | none | {VN-direct\|Low} |

> **Correction.** Earlier drafts used a Region I minimum wage of 4,960,000 VND/month. That was the 2024 to 2025 level. From 1 January 2026 it is 5,310,000 VND/month under Decree 293/2025/ND-CP of 10 November 2025 [@COST-19].

- **Regions.** Region I covers the urban wards of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi and the Bien Hoa area of Dong Nai.
- **Workforce assumption used in the cost stacks.** A skilled plant workforce averaging 12 to 20 million VND/month gross, with 13 months of pay and 23.5% on-costs, costs USD 7,400 to 12,350 per full-time employee (FTE) a year (our calculation, 12 to 20 million x 13 x 1.235 / 26,000). This is an assumption, not a survey figure.

### S12.5 Land and buildings

Q2 2026, Cushman & Wakefield [@COST-21; @COST-22] {VN-direct|Medium}:

| Market | Industrial land, USD/m2 for the remaining lease term | Occupancy | Ready-built factory, USD/m2/month | Ready-built warehouse, USD/m2/month |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| South average | 186.4 | not given | 4.9 | 4.6 |
| Ho Chi Minh City (including former Binh Duong and Ba Ria-Vung Tau) | 187.5 | 86.1% | 5.1 | 4.5 |
| Dong Nai (including former Binh Phuoc) | 189.6 | 73.1% | 4.9 | 4.7 |
| Tay Ninh (including former Long An) | 179.6 | 60.9% | 4.6 | 4.8 |
| North average (Hanoi, Bac Ninh, Hung Yen, Hai Phong, Phu Tho, Ninh Binh) | 137.7 | Hanoi near full | 5.0 | 4.9 |

- Industrial land is cheaper in the north; ready-built factory rents are about the same in both regions. Ready-built factory occupancy was 89.7 to 94.3% in the south and about 86% in the north [@COST-21; @COST-22] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Construction cost.** The Ministry of Construction's Decision 409/QD-BXD (11 April 2025, Q4 2024 price basis, 10% VAT included) contains official investment rates, but its industrial chapter was not readable [@COST-23] {VN-direct|Low}. The only figure we have is the GFI APAC and Hawkwood input of USD 1,672/m2 for Vietnam (construction score 93), against USD 1,487/m2 for Indonesia (score 100) [@RGN-01] {VN-direct|Medium}.

### S12.6 Taxes and duties

- **VAT on food and other goods.** Processed protein foods pay more VAT than fresh meat at the trading stage. Under the Law on VAT 48/2024/QH15, the standard rate is 10%. The 5% rate covers clean water, fertiliser and unprocessed farm products at the commercial stage (Art 9(2)) [@COST-24] {VN-direct|High}. A temporary cut from 10% to 8% for many goods has applied since 1 July 2025 (Resolution 204/2025/QH15; Decree 174/2025/ND-CP), and it ends on 31 December 2026 [@COST-25; @FTR-37] {VN-direct|High}. Goods subject to excise are excluded from the cut; from 1 January 2026 that includes sugary drinks above 5 g of sugar per 100 ml (Ministry of Finance Letter 17380/BTC-CST) [@FTR-09] {VN-direct|High}. Fresh meat, fish and eggs are not subject to VAT at the producer and import stage and pay 5% at the trading stage; processed foods, plant-based or not, including tofu, *đồ chay* (traditional vegetarian foods), plant-based meat, processed meat and protein ingredients, pay 10% (8% to the end of 2026) [@COST-24; @FTR-37] {VN-direct|Medium}. So a processed protein product carries a 3 to 5 point VAT handicap against fresh meat at the trading stage, and we found no VAT, excise or income-tax line that favours plant-based or high-protein foods (our reading). Import VAT on food ingredients is creditable for a VAT-registered buyer, so it does not change the comparison between domestic and imported ingredients.
- **VAT on feed (context).** This matters only for a plant selling feed, which the study no longer treats as something to make. Under the Law on VAT 48/2024/QH15 (Art 5(3), in force 1 July 2025), animal feed and aquafeed are "not subject to VAT" [@COST-24] {VN-direct|High}. "Not subject" is not the same as zero-rated: a plant making a feed protein cannot reclaim the VAT it pays on equipment, power and inputs. Feed millers can no longer deduct the 5% VAT they paid on inputs [@MAC-25] {VN-direct|Medium}. By our estimate, at 10% VAT on roughly half to all of costs, this adds about 5 to 10% to a feed-protein plant's taxed input costs. A food-ingredient plant, taxed at 8 or 10%, can reclaim input VAT. Whether a new feed ingredient such as SCP automatically counts as "animal feed" for VAT is an open question.
- **Corporate income tax (CIT).** Law 67/2025/QH15 sets a standard rate of 20% with preferential rates for encouraged sectors and areas. Decree 320/2025/ND-CP (15 December 2025) adds two tests that matter for alternative protein. First, the exemption for processed farm and aquatic products needs agricultural or aquatic raw materials to be at least 30% of production cost; a cassava-based fermentation plant probably passes, and a plant running on imported refined sugar may not (our interpretation). Second, income from products made with a technology applied for the first time in Vietnam is exempt for 3 years, once an authority confirms the technology is new [@REG2-18] {VN-direct|High}. The chapter on high-technology projects (10% for 15 years; 4 years' exemption plus 9 years at 50%) did not render. The GFI APAC and Hawkwood study cites Vietnamese incentives of cash support up to 10% of new fixed assets, 10% CIT for 15 years, and a 4-year tax holiday plus 9 years at 50% [@RGN-01] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Import duty on machinery.** Imported fixed-asset goods of projects in incentivised sectors or areas are exempt (Decree 134/2016/ND-CP Art 14, as amended by Decree 18/2021/ND-CP). We did not read the texts; see [[app-s9-regulation]].
- **Import duty on protein inputs** (2025 to 2027). The table gives most-favoured-nation (MFN) rates, which apply to countries without a trade agreement with Vietnam, and preferential rates for China, ASEAN and Korea under the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Area (AKFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). HS codes are customs codes in the harmonised system [@REG2-20; @REG2-21; @REG2-23; @FTR-32; @FTR-33] {VN-direct|Medium}:

| HS code | Product | MFN rate (latest found) | ACFTA, ATIGA, AKFTA and RCEP |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1201.90 | Soybeans | 0% | not checked (MFN is 0%) |
| 2304.00.29, 2304.00.90 | Soybean meal | 0% (from 31 March 2025) | 0% |
| 2304.00.10 | Defatted soy flour for human food | 0% | 0% |
| 2304.00.21 | Crude (not defatted) soy flour for human food | 2% | not checked |
| 1208.10 | Full-fat soy flour and meal | 8% | 0% |
| 1005.90.99 | Feed maize | 0% (from 31 March 2025; was 2%) | not checked (MFN is 0%) |
| 2301.20 | Fishmeal | 0% | not checked (MFN is 0%) |
| 1109 | Wheat gluten | 10% | 0% |
| 2106.10 | Protein concentrates and textured protein | 5% | 0% |
| 3504 | Peptones and other protein substances | 3% | 0% |
| 2102.10 | Active yeast | 10% | 0% (AKFTA not checked) |
| 2102.20 | Inactive yeast and other dead single-cell organisms | 7% | 0% (AKFTA not checked) |

**Food protein ingredients carry small MFN duties, but only on origins without a trade agreement, chiefly the United States.** Chinese, ASEAN and Korean product pays 0% with a certificate of origin, so a domestic textured-protein, gluten or single-cell-protein maker has no tariff edge over Chinese product [@FTR-32; @FTR-33] {VN-direct|Medium}. A maker buying full-fat soy flour from the United States would pay 8% while Chinese textured protein enters free. The MFN column of MOIT's trade repository is out of date for lines amended in 2025, so MFN rates were taken only for lines no amending decree touched [@FTR-32] {VN-direct|Medium}. We do not know whether importers actually claim the preference. For context, feed protein enters duty-free, so domestic novel feed proteins get no tariff shelter.

### S12.7 Logistics

Not established. The only data point: in March and April 2026, as oil prices rose with the Middle East conflict, the press reported logistics costs up 20 to 30% for international and 15 to 20% for domestic transport [@COST-33] {VN-direct|Low}. Trucking cost per tonne-km, container rates to Singapore or Shanghai and cold-chain rates are gaps.

## Part two. Commodity and retail prices

### S12.8 Commodity prices

The table gives world and Vietnamese prices for sugar and urea (the carbon and nitrogen inputs of fermentation) and for food and feed commodities. Fishmeal, soybean meal, maize and compound feed are context: they are the imported inputs behind the meat, eggs and farmed fish people eat. CIF means cost, insurance and freight paid to the destination port; CP means crude protein; ISA is the International Sugar Agreement price.

| Commodity (market) | January 2025 | March 2026 | August 2026 | Per t of protein, latest | Sources | Label |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fishmeal, Peru 65%, CIF (World Bank series) | USD 1,581/t (2025 average 1,706) | USD 1,837/t | USD 2,500/t | USD 3,846 (August 2026); USD 2,625 (2025 average); our calculation at 65% protein | [@COST-27; @FM-01; @FM-02] | {general\|High} |
| Soybean meal, Argentine 45/46%, CIF Rotterdam | USD 368/t (low 335 in July 2025; 2025 average 366) | USD 404/t | USD 403/t | about USD 876 (46% CP) | [@COST-28; @FM-01] | {general\|High} |
| Soybeans, US, CIF Rotterdam | USD 411/t | USD 473/t | USD 482/t | not given | [@COST-31; @FM-01] | {general\|High} |
| Maize, US No. 2, FOB Gulf | USD 214/t | USD 213/t | USD 224/t | not given | [@COST-29; @FM-01] | {general\|High} |
| Urea, bulk (World Bank series) | USD 472/t (February 2026) | USD 726/t | USD 390/t (Q2 2026 average 693.5) | not given | [@COST-30; @FM-01] | {general\|High} |

- **Corn origins.** Vietnam imported 6.8 Mt of corn in H1 2026 (up 53% year on year) worth USD 1.71 bn; in January to May, Brazil supplied 44%, Argentina 31% and India 0.5 Mt, a new source, at unit values of USD 247 (Brazil), 252 (Argentina) and 252/t (India) [@COST-34] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Urea.** A second press series, citing DTN data (likely US retail prices), gave urea at USD 674/t in March 2026 [@COST-33]; the direction (a sharp spring rise) agrees with the World Bank series, which fell back to USD 390/t by August [@FM-01].
- **Cassava, rice by-products and sugar.** Vietnamese prices are in [[app-s4-feedstocks]]: fresh cassava roots 3,000 to 3,550 VND/kg (April 2026), native starch 12,500 to 13,200 VND/kg and USD 520 to 540/t FOB, average domestic sugar price about 16,505 VND/kg (June 2026), rice bran 7,300 to 7,650 VND/kg (September 2026) [@FS-11; @FS-12; @FS-31; @FS-26] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Gaps.** Vietnamese domestic fishmeal prices by grade (55, 60, 65% CP), domestic soybean meal in VND/kg, distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS), meat and bone meal, poultry by-product meal, fish oil, glucose syrup, bulk molasses and ammonium sulphate.

> **Correction.** Wave 1 used Peruvian fishmeal at USD 1,837/t (March 2026), about USD 2,830 per tonne of protein, as the fishmeal benchmark. Wave 2 read the September 2026 Pink Sheet: the 2025 average was USD 1,706/t (about USD 2,625 per tonne of protein) and August 2026 was USD 2,500/t (about USD 3,846 per tonne of protein). Soybean meal was about USD 403/t in August 2026, about USD 880 per tonne of protein [@FM-01]. This appendix compares against both the 2025 average (base case) and August 2026 (latest). A Vietnamese buyer's quote of USD 1,600/t for November 2025 was below the World Bank's USD 1,794/t that month, probably a lower grade or non-Peruvian origin [@FM-04; @FM-02].

### S12.9 Protein ingredients Vietnam imports

2023, UN Comtrade via WITS (the World Bank's World Integrated Trade Solution) [@COST-36; @COST-37; @COST-38] {VN-direct|Low}:

| HS code | Product | Import value | Quantity (likely imputed) | Unit value | Main origins |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1109 | Wheat gluten | USD 31.06 M | 12,337 t | USD 2.52/kg | China 59%, Australia, France |
| 2106.10 | Protein concentrates and textured protein substances | USD 33.98 M | 5,763 t | USD 5.90/kg | United States 46%, China 27% |
| 3504 | Peptones and other protein substances (including some isolates) | USD 22.18 M | 2,421 t | USD 9.16/kg | China 45%, United States |

Every partner shows exactly the same unit value, which suggests the database estimated the quantities. Treat values as reliable and unit values as weak. HS 2106.10 also includes nutrition premixes, so it is not a clean price for textured vegetable protein (TVP). There is no separate code for pea protein. We found no global benchmark prices for soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, TVP or pea protein.

### S12.10 Retail prices of the proteins an alternative would replace, per 100 g of protein

| Product | Retail price | Protein, g per 100 g | VND per 100 g of protein | USD per 100 g of protein | Source | Label |

- Meat and egg prices are Bach Hoa Xanh online, Ho Chi Minh City, 23 September 2026, many at small promotional discounts. Tofu and analogues are from our field audit in Ho Chi Minh City on 16 and 20 September 2026, except Tafu and An Nhien, which are online reference prices (accessed 21 September 2026). Meat protein contents are typical food-composition values, not re-checked against the Vietnamese Food Composition Table. Retail pangasius was not found.
- **Retail audit medians** (VND per 100 g of protein, September 2026; an SKU, or stock-keeping unit, is one product line): tofu 66,265 (5 SKUs; range 39,171 to 121,053); dried TVP and soy chunks 64,584 (4 SKUs; range 48,976 to 85,053); frozen meat and seafood analogues 278,667 (9 SKUs); protein powders 359,537 (4 SKUs); plant milks 456,250 (8 SKUs) [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. See [[app-s2-retail-audit]].
- **Reading.** Chicken and eggs set the retail floor at about 34,000 to 46,600 VND per 100 g of protein. Tofu sits at a similar level. Dried soy analogues are already priced near chicken on a protein basis. Printed tofu protein varies two-fold between labels, so label-based comparisons are fragile.

## Part three. Techno-economic benchmarks

### S12.11 Verified TEA benchmarks

The table lists the published benchmarks we checked. Most are global models for US or European sites, not Vietnamese costs. Capital expenditure (capex) is the cost of building the plant and its equipment.

**Notes on the mycoprotein TEA** [@COST-43] {general|High}. The model runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, assumes 5% financing over 20 years and fixed costs of 3% of annualised capex, and excludes land, working capital and start-up. The authors compare USD 29.56 per kg of protein with about USD 29.95 for choice beef and about USD 9.64 for chicken, and conclude that mycoprotein can match beef on protein cost but "will not be an economic alternative for inexpensive products such as chicken". Buying food-grade biotin and zinc sulphate instead of lab grade cut cost by 22%.

### S12.12 Capital cost per m3 and per annual tonne

| Source | Plant | Total capex | Reactor volume | Capex per m3 (our calculation) | Capex per annual tonne (our calculation) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vlaeminck et al. 2023 [@COST-44] | Feed SCP, 20 kt/yr | USD 320 M | 6,247 m3 | about USD 51,000 | USD 16,000 (dry) |
| Risner et al. 2023 [@COST-43] | Food mycoprotein, about 4.7 kt/yr dry (our calculation from Risner inputs) | USD 108 M (excludes land, working capital and start-up) | 310 m3 (2 x 155 m3) | about USD 350,000 | about USD 22,800 (dry); about USD 6,200 (wet) |
| Humbird 2021 [@COST-47] | Cultured meat, perfusion, 6.9 kt/yr wet | USD 663 M | not given | not given | about USD 96,000 (wet cells) |

Capex per m3 of reactor differs about 7-fold between the two verified microbial studies (our calculation, 350,000 / 51,000) {general|High}. The spread comes from design choices (large, low-cost airlift reactors versus many small reactors), hygiene grade (feed versus food) and the estimating method. We do not average them. A Vietnamese plan should build its own equipment-level estimate rather than borrow one figure.

### S12.13 Where the cost is: why cheap labour and power matter less than capital

- **The GFI APAC and Hawkwood representative models.** In the study's own plant models, labour is 5% of production cost for submerged biomass (80,000 t/yr) and 4% for precision fermentation (10,000 t/yr); utilities are 7% and 17%; depreciation (capital) is 10% and 18% [@RGN-01] {general|High}. Feedstock, the largest cost, is 56% (biomass) and 37% (precision fermentation) in those models, consistent with the 35 to 65% (biomass) and 30 to 45% (precision fermentation) the report cites from other TEAs [@RGN-01]. The models were run for a US Midwest plant on corn glucose, not for any Asian site.
- **Vietnam's scores in that study** (0 to 100, 100 = best): labour 100, utilities 97, construction cost 93, business environment 30, sugar capability 26, talent 26, regulatory readiness 0. Indonesia matches or beats Vietnam on labour, utilities and construction; Vietnam is ahead on sugar (26 against 14) [@RGN-01] {VN-direct|High}.
- **Our own stack.** In the fungal biomass stack below (cost stack A, built as a feed ingredient), capital charge plus maintenance is 54% of cost at the low end and 67% at the high end (our calculation). In the off-gas SCP TEA, facility-dependent costs are 58% and utilities 18% [@COST-44] {general|High}.
- **Reading.** Vietnam's cost advantage acts on a small share of cost. Capital, feedstock and the price of the protein being replaced decide the case.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said labour is 7% and 17% of cost, utilities 4 to 5%, depreciation 37 to 56% and feedstock 10% and 18% in the GFI APAC and Hawkwood models; the source gives labour 5% and 4%, utilities 7% and 17%, depreciation 10% and 18%, and feedstock 56% and 37%.

## Part four. Vietnamese estimates

### S12.14 Tropical cooling (indicative estimate)

We found no published analysis of fermentation cooling in hot, humid climates, and no study that quantifies the cooling cost saved by thermotolerant strains in a tropical plant (our literature search). High-temperature fermentation is expected to reduce the cost of bioconversion [@SCI-45] {general|Medium}. So we built an indicative estimate from general engineering rules. Label: {VN-direct|Low} for the result.

| Step | Input | Value | Source or basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heat released by aerobic growth | 460 kJ per mol of O2 consumed | at 0.83 to 1.25 kg O2 per kg of dry biomass: 12 to 18 MJ, or 3.3 to 5.0 kWh of heat, per kg | [@COST-50] (rule cited from Roels 1983) |
| Agitation and aeration power | not a cooling cost | about 0.5 to 1.0 kWh per kg | assumption |
| Scale check | Baker's yeast plant, 7 x 150 m3 bubble columns, Germany | simulated average of about 11 MW (8 to 14 MW), about 10.5 kW per m3 across all seven reactors (our calculation; about 5 run at once) | [@COST-52] |
| Cooling water in southern Vietnam | design wet-bulb about 27 to 28 C | cooling towers deliver water at about 31 to 33 C | assumption (not sourced) |
| Broth temperature | *Fusarium*, *Aspergillus*, most yeasts | 28 to 32 C, so the coolant has to be about 5 to 20 C: mostly chilled water | assumption |
| Temperate comparison | design wet-bulb about 18 to 20 C | tower water about 23 to 25 C; cooling water covers most hours | assumption |
| Relative utility cost | cooling water versus chilled water | cooling water is 4 to 8 times cheaper per unit of heat | [@COST-50] (Towler and Sinnott) |
| Chiller power | temperate design 0.56 kW per ton of refrigeration | tropical assumption 0.75 to 0.9 kW per ton including pumps and fans, a system coefficient of performance (COP, heat removed per unit of power) of about 4.0 to 4.7 | [@COST-51]; assumption |
| Chilled-water electricity | 3.3 to 5.0 kWh heat / COP, plus pumps | 0.81 to 1.5 kWh per kg of dry biomass (against 0.10 to 0.15 with cooling water only) | our calculation |
| **Energy penalty** | 0.7 to 1.35 kWh per kg x USD 0.075 to 0.078 per kWh | **USD 52 to 105 per tonne** | our calculation |
| Chiller capex | 10 kt/yr, 8,000 h/yr; peak 1,750 to 3,200 tons of refrigeration x USD 800 to 1,500 per ton installed | USD 1.4 to 4.8 M, or USD 21 to 72 per tonne a year at a 15% capital charge | our calculation; unit cost assumed |
| **Total penalty** | energy plus capital | **about USD 70 to 180 per tonne of dry biomass** | our calculation |

- **Size of the penalty.** USD 70 to 180/t is roughly 2 to 4% of the indicative cost of fungal biomass protein (cost stack A) in most cases, and 1 to 8% at the extremes (our calculation, against USD 2,227 to 6,612/t). The extra cooling electricity (0.7 to 1.35 kWh/kg) is about half to 1.7 times the plant's other electricity use (0.8 to 1.5 kWh/kg), but electricity is a small share of total cost.
- **Avoiding it.** Strains that grow at 40 to 45 C can use tower water (our inference). *Kluyveromyces marxianus* SS106, isolated from Thai cassava pulp, reached 36 to 46 g/L of cell mass in repeated batches (39.3 g/L in a single batch) at 40 C on raw cassava starch [@SCI-44] {VN-adjacent|High}. A model of a 600 m3 bubble column on ethanol found that a 30 C broth needs chilled water while a 45 C broth can use cooling water; the same model could make up to 58 kt/yr of SCP [@COST-50] {general|Medium}. Hybrid pre-cooling with tower water also removes much of the penalty.

> **Correction.** Earlier drafts implied that tropical cooling "may offset" Vietnam's power-cost advantage. In energy terms that is partly right, but the overall effect is about 2 to 4% of the cost of fungal biomass protein in cost stack A, and thermotolerant strains avoid most of it (our calculation above; [@COST-50; @COST-51; @COST-52]).

### S12.15 Cost stack A: fungal biomass protein for feed

> **Read with care.** We built this stack for a feed ingredient. The study now concentrates on protein for people. [[ch09-economics]] (section 9.3) sets the same stack against food comparators and explains why a food-grade plant would cost more. The stack and the fishmeal and soybean-meal comparison below stay here as context and as the record.

Submerged aerobic fermentation on sugar, dried, 45 to 55% CP; 10,000 t/yr; USD per tonne of product; 2026 prices at 26,000 VND/USD; excluding VAT, sales, distribution and profit. Indicative, not a feasibility study. Label for the result: {VN-direct|Low}.

| Line | Low | High | Basis | Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Carbon (2.0 to 2.2 t of glucose equivalent per t; yield 0.45 to 0.50 g/g) | 600 | 1,100 | USD 300 to 500/t of glucose equivalent. The low end is near world raw sugar (USD 330/t in March 2026 [@COST-32]; USD 380/t in August 2026 [@FM-01]); the high end is a refined cassava starch or syrup assumption. Near-free residues (cassava pulp) could cut this line but need pretreatment ([[app-s4-feedstocks]]) | assumption on measured prices |
| Nitrogen (0.17 to 0.20 t of urea per t) | 72 | 145 | Phu My urea about USD 425/t (from March 2026; 50 kg bag assumed) [@COST-33] to the world spike of USD 726/t (March 2026) [@COST-30]. World urea fell back to USD 390/t by August 2026 [@FM-01], so the low end is not understated | measured prices; assumed use |
| Minerals, vitamins, antifoam, enzymes | 50 | 150 | Assumption; trace ingredients can matter (food-grade biotin and zinc cut mycoprotein cost by 22%) [@COST-43] | assumption |
| Electricity excluding cooling (0.8 to 1.5 kWh/kg) | 58 | 117 | 1,895 VND/kWh (DPPA example) [@COST-06] to 2,020 VND/kWh (6 to 22 kV blended) [@COST-01] | measured price; assumed use |
| Cooling electricity (0.1 to 1.5 kWh/kg) | 7 | 117 | S12.14: from a thermotolerant or cooling-water case to full chilled water | our estimate |
| Steam (4.5 to 6.5 t per t, for sterilisation, cleaning and drying) | 78 | 218 | 450 to 870 VND of fuel per kg of steam: 450 lies within our husk-pellet calculation of 420 to 585 (S12.3) [@COST-16]; 870 is the top of a supplier claim for wood pellets [@COST-17] | measured prices; assumed use |
| Water and wastewater (20 to 40 m3 per t) | 18 | 58 | USD 0.64/m3 water, all-in, which already includes a drainage and wastewater service charge, so the line may double count slightly [@COST-10]; plus USD 0.28 to 0.40/m3 measured park treatment (0.40 includes solid waste) [@COST-13; @COST-14], up to 0.80 with an assumed COD surcharge | measured prices; assumed use and surcharge |
| Labour (60 to 100 FTE) | 44 | 124 | USD 7,400 to 12,350 per FTE a year (assumption, S12.4; above the national statistics office average of 9.0 million VND a month [@COST-20]) | assumption on measured wages |
| Land (5 to 8 ha) | 99 | 185 | USD 186/m2 for the lease term [@COST-21], annualised over 30 to 40 years at 10 to 12% | measured price; assumed area |
| Capital charge (capex USD 8,000 to 20,000 per annual t; 12 to 18% a year) | 960 | 3,600 | Capex set below and at the verified TEAs (USD 16,000 to 22,800 per annual t) [@COST-43; @COST-44], allowing 20 to 40% localisation savings; charge factor brackets Humbird's 15% [@COST-47] | assumption anchored on TEAs |
| Maintenance and insurance (3 to 4% of capex) | 240 | 800 | Assumption | assumption |
| **Total, USD per t of product** | **2,227** | **6,612** | = 58,000 to 172,000 VND/kg (our calculation) | |
| **USD per t of protein** | **4,050** | **14,700** | Low at 55% CP (2,227 / 0.55); high at 45% CP (6,612 / 0.45) (our calculation) | |

**Comparison with fishmeal and soybean meal (context).** Fishmeal protein cost about USD 2,625 per tonne at the 2025 average price and USD 3,846 in August 2026 [@FM-01] {general|High}. So the low end of the stack (USD 4,050 per tonne of protein) is about 54% above fishmeal at the 2025 average and about 5% above it at the August 2026 price (our calculation, 4,050 / 2,625 and 4,050 / 3,846). Soybean-meal protein (about USD 880 per tonne) is 4.6 to 5.1 times cheaper than the low end ([[app-s6-feed-market]]).

**Sensitivities (our calculation).**

- **Near-free carbon.** Removing the USD 600 carbon line from the low case gives USD 1,627 per tonne of product, about USD 2,960 per tonne of protein at 55% CP: below fishmeal protein at the August 2026 price (USD 3,846), but still about 13% above the 2025 average (USD 2,625).
- **Capital.** The low case already assumes capex of USD 8,000 per annual tonne, half of the lowest verified TEA. At the verified USD 16,000 to 22,800 per annual tonne, the capital charge alone would be USD 1,920 to 4,100 per tonne of product at 12 to 18% (our calculation).
- **Capital dominates.** Capital charge plus maintenance is 54% of the low case ((960 + 240) / 2,227) and 67% of the high case ((3,600 + 800) / 6,612) (our calculation).
- **Published feed TEAs agree.** Production cost or minimum selling price of USD 2,070 to 4,150 per tonne of SCP [@COST-44; @COST-45] also sit at or above fishmeal on a protein basis.

**Not included, and pushing the high case up if the product is sold as feed.** Because feed is not subject to VAT, input VAT on capex and taxed inputs is not reclaimable, adding about 5 to 10% on those inputs (S12.6). The feed-ingredient listing process also takes time (6 to 18 months by our estimate; [[app-s6-feed-market]]).

### S12.16 Cost stack B: textured soy protein (TVP)

Dry TVP from food-grade, low-temperature defatted soy flour by low-moisture extrusion (cooking and shaping the flour under heat and pressure) on a Chinese-equipped line; two line sizes (0.5 and 1 t/h) at 50, 70 and 90% utilisation of 8,000 hours a year; USD per tonne of product; 2026 prices; including delivery to the buyer, a capital charge and working-capital interest; excluding VAT, sales and profit. Protein taken as 52%. Indicative. Rebuilt from the textured-protein investor card of research wave 7 (line W7-L5); the full rows are in `t1_cost_per_kg.csv`. Label for the result: {VN-direct|Low}.

**Inputs.**

| Line | Value used | Basis | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Food-grade defatted soy flour, delivered | USD 627 to 925 per t; 1.03 to 1.07 t per t of product (USD 646 to 990 per t of product) | Low: China's soybean-meal exports to Vietnam at USD 604 per t FOB in 2025 (28,158 t, grade unknown) plus 3% freight. High: Indian and Dutch soy flour at USD 782 to 896 per t FOB (2024 and 2025), USD 850 used, plus 5% freight, 2% MFN duty as modelled (the crude-flour rate, HS 2304.00.21; defatted food-grade flour, HS 2304.00.10, pays 0%, so the high end is about 2% too high) and USD 15 per t local [@TIC-12; @TIC-13; @REG2-21] | measured trade prices; grade assumed |
| Electricity | 150 to 350 kWh per t at 1,952 VND per kWh (22 kV, 24-hour blend) | Supply-chapter range, supported by the power ratings in the listings (about 80 to 375 kWh per t, depending on throughput within the stated ranges) [@COST-01; @TIC-02; @TIC-10] | measured price; assumed use |
| Dryer heat; water and wastewater; bulk bags for business buyers; outbound delivery | 0.4 to 0.8 t of steam per t; USD 2 to 7; USD 10 to 20; USD 10 to 30 per t | Steam price as stack A [@COST-16; @COST-17]; steam use, water, bags and delivery are assumptions | measured price; assumed use |
| Labour | 18 to 28 FTE (0.5 t/h) or 22 to 34 FTE (1 t/h) at USD 5,560 to 12,350 per FTE a year | Low: average income of 9.0 million VND a month [@COST-20], with 13 months and 23.5% on-costs assumed; high: 20 million VND (assumption) | assumption on measured wages |
| Rent | 1,500 to 2,000 m2 (0.5 t/h) or 2,000 to 3,000 m2 (1 t/h) at USD 4.9 to 5.1 per m2 a month | Ready-built factory, Q2 2026 [@COST-21; @COST-22] | measured price; assumed area |
| Installed capex | USD 0.28 to 1.0 M (0.5 t/h); USD 0.32 to 1.38 M (1 t/h) | Listed Chinese line with dryer at USD 30,000 to 300,000 (up to three times list), plus freight, installation, utilities, bagging and QA, food-grade fit-out, certification and a 15% contingency (our calculation) [@TIC-02; @TIC-03; @TIC-07] | listings plus assumptions |
| Capital charge; maintenance | 12 to 18% of installed capex; 4 to 6% a year | Supply-chapter range; assumption | assumption |
| QA, certification, insurance, administration | USD 60,000 to 150,000 a year | Assumption | assumption |
| Working capital and interest | 3 to 4 months of revenue at parity (USD 0.72 to 1.73 M at 0.5 t/h; 1.44 to 3.46 M at 1 t/h); 8 to 10% a year | Assumption: 1.5 months of imported flour, 1 month of stock for lunar peaks, 1.5 months of receivables | assumption |

**Results.**

| Line size | Utilisation | Output, t a year | Full cost, low case, USD per t | Full cost, high case, USD per t | Raw material share | Capital charge, USD per t | VND per 100 g of protein |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 t/h | 50% | 2,000 | 858 | 1,573 | 75% to 63% | 17 to 91 | 4,290 to 7,860 |
| 0.5 t/h | 70% | 2,800 | 816 | 1,450 | 79% to 68% | 12 to 65 | 4,080 to 7,250 |
| 0.5 t/h | 90% | 3,600 | 793 | 1,382 | 81% to 72% | 9 to 50 | 3,970 to 6,910 |
| 1 t/h | 50% | 4,000 | 800 | 1,414 | 81% to 70% | 9 to 62 | 4,000 to 7,070 |
| 1 t/h | 70% | 5,600 | 774 | 1,337 | 83% to 74% | 7 to 44 | 3,870 to 6,680 |
| 1 t/h | 90% | 7,200 | 761 | 1,294 | 85% to 77% | 5 to 34 | 3,800 to 6,470 |

Our calculation [@TIC-12; @TIC-13; @COST-01; @COST-19; @COST-20; @COST-21] {VN-direct\|Low}. The low case pairs all low inputs and the high case all high inputs. With a European-grade line (unverified; USD 2.0 to 5.6 M installed on the earlier equipment assumption of USD 1.5 to 4.0 M), the capital charge would be USD 33 to 181 per t.

**Reading.**

- **Flour is the cost.** Raw material is 63 to 85% of full cost. The two cases differ by USD 344 per t on flour alone; all other costs together run USD 115 to 304 per t at 1 t/h and 90%, and up to USD 583 at 0.5 t/h and 50%. Scale and utilisation matter only in the high-cost case (our calculation).
- **Equipment is not the barrier.** With Chinese equipment the capital charge is USD 5 to 91 per t, 1 to 6% of full cost. Working capital, USD 0.6 to 3.5 M, is the larger funding need {VN-direct|Low}.
- **The competitor lands inside the domestic range.** In 2025 China shipped HS 2106.10 to Vietnam at USD 1.24 per kg FOB (10,201 t), its lowest price to any of eight Asian and US partners (world average USD 1.95) [@TIC-12; @TIC-14] {VN-direct|Medium}. Landed at the 0% ACFTA or RCEP duty it actually pays, it costs about USD 1.29 to 1.38 per kg (USD 1.35 to 1.44 if the 5% MFN duty applied; freight and port costs assumed) [@TIC-12; @BUY-02; @FTR-32; @FTR-33; @REG2-20] {VN-direct|Medium}. India shipped 2,372 t at USD 0.98 per kg, which lands at about USD 1.08 to 1.15 [@BUY-02] {VN-direct|Medium}. The domestic full cost is USD 0.76 to 1.57 per kg, so the delivered flour price decides the margin (our calculation; `t1_landed_competitor.csv`).
- **Margin and breakeven.** At Chinese parity with 0% duty, the low case earns 33 to 41% and pays back in about a year; the high case runs from a 22% loss to breakeven. To earn 15% on a 1 t/h line at 70% utilisation, delivered flour has to cost less than about USD 700 to 940 per t (our calculation; `t1_margin_payback.csv`) {VN-direct|Low}. Chinese lines are on sale in Ho Chi Minh City, yet no one has built one, which suggests the low flour price is not available for food-grade, low-temperature, often non-GMO (not genetically modified) flour (our inference). A written quote for delivered flour is the decisive number.
- **No input advantage.** Vietnam crushes about 1.8 to 2.1 Mt of soybeans a year for feed meal (USDA Post forecasts for MY2024/25 and MY2025/26) [@FORM-09] {VN-direct|Medium}; the new VAL complex at Phu My alone can process 2.6 Mt [@FORM-10] {VN-direct|Medium}. We found no food-grade defatted flake stream. Vietnam grows only about 1.6% of its soybean supply (42 kt against 2.61 Mt imported in 2025; our calculation from [@MAC-04; @MAC-09]). A Vietnamese line buys most of its cost from the countries whose product it replaces, and its natural shelter is only the freight and port cost on the finished product, about USD 50 to 140 per t (our calculation, `t1_landed_competitor.csv`), less the freight on its own imported flour.
- **Manufacturing cost is not what blocks plant-based foods.** The ex-factory cost of 3,800 to 7,900 VND per 100 g of protein (our calculation, `t1_cost_per_kg.csv`) [@TIC-02; @TIC-12] is about 4 to 19 times below retail meat and egg protein (34,300 to 70,900 VND per 100 g; S12.10) [@COST-39; @COST-40; @COST-41]. Retail dried soy analogues sell at about 51,000 VND per 100 g of protein (one product) and a median of 64,584 across four products [@COST-42; @FORM-01], about 6 to 17 times the ex-factory cost (our calculation). The gap is distribution, brand and retail margin, and product quality.
- **A different, dearer product.** The earlier stack (3,000 t a year on one 1 t/h line, USD 792 to 2,065 per t) assumed European-scale equipment and, in its high case, a 50:50 blend of soy flour and soy protein concentrate at USD 1,300 per t. A concentrate-based texturate is a separate, dearer product; this stack covers plain flour-based TVP.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said Vietnam crushes about 2.6 Mt of soybeans a year; that is the capacity of one new plant (VAL, Phu My). USDA Post forecasts the national crush at 1.8 Mt (MY2024/25) to 2.1 Mt (MY2025/26).

### S12.17 Caveats

1. **Indicative only.** Both stacks mix measured Vietnamese prices with engineering assumptions. They show which lines matter; they are not a basis for an investment decision.
2. **Capex is the swing factor for fermentation** and is the least Vietnamese of the inputs. No Vietnamese fermentation or extrusion capex was found; equipment majors' Vietnamese presence was not verified ([[app-s5-facilities]]). For textured soy the swing factor is the delivered flour price, not capex; the Chinese equipment prices are list prices, not quotes.
3. **Electricity may change.** A capacity charge could apply from July 2026, and Decree 278/2026 allows more frequent price moves.
4. **Fishmeal is volatile (context).** The August 2026 price is one month's value. The comparison with fishmeal changes from 54% above to 5% above between the 2025 average and August 2026.
5. **Cooling is an estimate** built from general rules and an unsourced wet-bulb assumption.
6. **Tax treatment is unresolved.** Whether a new feed ingredient counts as "animal feed" for VAT, and whether a fermentation plant qualifies for high-technology CIT incentives, are open questions ([[app-s9-regulation]]).
7. **Currency.** All conversions use 26,000 VND per USD; the rate rose about 3 to 3.5% in 2025 [@MAC-25] {VN-direct|Medium}.
