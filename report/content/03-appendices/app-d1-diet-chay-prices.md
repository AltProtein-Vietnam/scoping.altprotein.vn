# D1. Protein diet, chay and price data

**What this appendix contains.** The micro data behind [[ch11-protein-diet]] and [[ch12-chay-baseline]], generated from the data files named in each section. Different sources measure different things (food supply, individual intake, household acquisition for home use), so we never average them.

## D1.1 Which source measures what

| School menus and weighed boarding diets [@PMR-26; @UPL-01; @UPL-18] | Published lunch nutrition sheets (Hanoi); published upland boarding menus (13 schools, our register `upland_school_weeks.csv`); kitchen-weighed diets (two Yen Bai schools) | As planned or as served | 2019 to 2026 | What children's school plates carry (D1.10) |

## D1.6 The protein ladder: Vietnam and its neighbours

Animal share of protein supply, meat supply and income. Selected years from `demand_protein_ladder.csv` (1961 to 2023). Transfer assumption: neighbours show where diets have levelled off, not where Vietnam must go.

## D1.7 Chay practice: every survey and estimate we found

None of the surveys below is a probability sample with a diet question; online panels count tofu and soy milk as plant-based, so they measure familiarity with the incumbent. The one probability survey that asks about diet, the Diet Quality Questionnaire (2021), does not ask about chay but caps it; it is set out in D1.9.

The sources say the 2 to 3 times came from a fruit seller (the Hanoi chay shop gave no multiple), the 20 to 30% fall was feast-tray purchasing power at one Hanoi restaurant, and 100,000 to 200,000 VND was one Hanoi eatery's buffet; Ho Chi Minh City hotel chay buffets cost 190,000 to 650,000 VND.

## D1.9 National diet surveillance: the Diet Quality Questionnaire

The Global Diet Quality Project (GAIN, Harvard and Gallup) asked a nationally representative sample of 1,007 Vietnamese adults aged 15 and over, by mobile telephone in Vietnamese, whether they ate each of 29 food groups on the previous day. Fieldwork ran from 13 November to 12 December 2021, an ordinary month holding two principal chay days; the design effect is 2.56 and the maximum margin of error 4.9 points. The country web page gives the fieldwork a month later; the data file and Gallup's methods table agree on November to December, and we use those [@APR-36; @BRD-02; @BRD-03; @BRD-04] {VN-direct|High} {dx:revealed}. The Vietnamese pulse item names *đậu khô, đậu nành, đậu phụ, sữa đậu nành hoặc bột đậu* (dried beans, soybeans, tofu, soy milk or bean flour), so it measures the daily reach of the incumbent soy foods; the processed-meat item leaves out *giò*, *chả* and *nem chua* (pork rolls, loaves and fermented pork), so it is a floor [@BRD-01; @BRD-02] {VN-direct|High}. Full rows: `diet_quality_vietnam.csv`.

Flesh-free shares are our calculation; food lists differ by country, so comparisons are indicative.

**What it tests (our calculation)** {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:inferred}:

- **The central chay assumption is supported as a ceiling only.** A chay day is flesh-free, so chay-day person-days cannot exceed 7.9% in a month without festivals. Part III's 2.5% (30% keeping 2.5 days a month) uses about a third of the ceiling. If Vietnam's other flesh-free days were at Cambodia's or the Philippines' level (3.3 to 5.8%), chay-type days would be 2.1 to 4.6% of person-days (illustrative, Low), which brackets 2.5%.
- **The top of the earlier range is contradicted in practice.** 6.7% would need 85% of all flesh-free days to be chay days and exceeds the lower confidence bound (5.3%); about 5% is a practical upper bound. The sensitivity range in [[ch18-demand-sizing]] (1.7 to 4.2%) sits inside the ceiling.
- **"About 10% of Vietnamese are vegetarian" is contradicted.** Ten per cent vegetarians plus even the low chay case would exceed the 11.0% upper bound of flesh-free days.
- **Processed meat cannot be tested.** The item omits *giò* and *chả* and counts days, not grams.
- **Legume supply and the chay-day protein assumption are consistent.** FAO balance sheets give soybeans and other pulses 6.94 g of protein per person a day in 2021; spread over the 40% of adults who eat legumes on a given day, that is about 17 g per eating day (supply, not intake), the same order as the 12 g a chay day is assumed to carry [@DIE-07; @APR-36].
- **A cheap next step.** Gallup holds the interview dates, so the flesh-free share on recall days that fell on the lunar 1st or 15th (about 65 of them, our estimate) can be compared with other days; at this sample size only an effect larger than a doubling would be detectable [@BRD-03; @BRD-07].

## D1.10 What children's school plates carry

The data behind the correction in [[ch11-protein-diet]] section 11.2: for school-age children, including upland boarders, protein and zinc are met at lunch and dinner, and the documented shortfalls are breakfast, calcium and vitamin A. Rows are selected from `upland_school_weeks.csv`, `protein_quality.csv`, `protein_food_micronutrients.csv` and `nutrition_trials.csv`; school channels are in [[ch15-channels]].

| Weighed diets | Kitchen-weighed boarding diets, two Yen Bai (now Lao Cai) schools: protein; zinc; calcium; vitamin A; vitamin B2, as % of need | 74.4 g a day (38% animal); 131 to 157%; 36.5%; 41 to 45%; 48 to 52% | 2019 | [@UPL-18] {VN-direct\|Medium} {dx:revealed} |
| Money | Border-commune lunch support (Decree 339/2025) | VND 450,000 a month plus 8 kg of rice; about 418,000 pupils (draft-stage estimate, press) | 2025 | [@APR-09; @UPL-22] {VN-direct\|Medium} {dx:revealed} |
| Quality | DIAAS: pork (older-child pattern); tofu; extruded soybean; wheat-based sausage | 113 to 137; 64 (0.5 to 3 year pattern) to 98 (older pattern); 65 to 97; 33 (in vitro) | various | [@NQR-05; @NQR-07; @NQR-09; @NQR-10] {general\|Medium} {dx:revealed} |
| Quality | DIAAS of a minced pork dish with 20 to 30% of its protein from textured soy (our calculation, additivity; extruded soybean as the soy proxy, so 97 is a conservative floor) | 97 or more | not applicable | [@NQR-05; @NQR-07] {general\|Medium} {dx:inferred} |
| Rules | Mandatory fortification (Decree 09/2016): vehicles | Iodised salt, wheat flour for processing (iron and zinc), vegetable oil (vitamin A); no soy product | 2016 | [@NQR-02] {VN-direct\|Medium} {dx:revealed} |
| Rules | Nutritional products for children up to 36 months | Must register; ordinary processed foods self-declare | 2018 | [@NQR-04] {VN-direct\|High} {dx:revealed} |
| Trials | Fortified biscuits (5.6 mg zinc, 6 mg iron), rural Vietnam, 510 children aged 6 to 8, four months | Risk of anaemia and zinc deficiency cut by more than 40% | 2009 | [@NQR-22] {VN-direct\|High} {dx:tested} |

Reading (our inference) {VN-direct|Medium} {dx:inferred}: no coded upland lunch was without meat, fish or egg, so a zinc-fortified soy dish sold to these kitchens would stretch pork, as tofu already does, rather than fill a gap. The documented gaps (breakfast, calcium, vitamin A) and stunting before age two point to other instruments. A fortified plant item for boarding breakfasts or charity-funded lunches is a research option to test on calcium and vitamin A as well as zinc.
