# S1. Company and actor directory

This appendix is a narrative guide to `companies.csv` (97 rows). It groups the actors by what they contribute to supply: making non-animal protein foods, making or importing protein ingredients, buying protein for feed, financing, and supporting the field. Each group has a compact table. The appendix ends with a dated timeline built from `timeline.csv` and wave 2 verification.

How to read the tables:

- **Location** is the current (post-1 July 2025) province, with the former unit in brackets where it changed. See [[app-s10-admin-map]].
- **Scale signal** is the best published indicator we found. "Claimed" means a company or press statement not checked against a filing. "Design capacity" is what a plant was built for, not what it makes.
- **Status** gives the last evidence of activity and the date of our last check. "Wave 1" rows were checked on 23 September 2026 by the ecosystem research; "wave 2" rows were re-checked the same day by a separate verification pass, which used direct page reads only. Many company sites failed to load in wave 2, so many rows carry only wave 1 evidence.
- **Sources** resolve in `sources.csv`. Where wave 2 changed a wave 1 value, the change is recorded in the `change_log` column of `companies.csv` and flagged below as a correction.

> **Method note.** The directory is broad but not complete. The wave 1 web-search budget ran out part way through (the ecosystem research logged about 40 searches and 60 page reads), and wave 2 used no web search at all (see the working papers and [[app-m1-method]]). Entities we could not confirm are kept and marked "lead" or "unverified". Absence of an actor here means "not found", not "does not exist".

## S1.1 Overview

- **Vietnam's real non-animal protein economy is incumbent, not startup.** Soy milk (Vinasoy and the dairy majors) and industrial *đồ chay* (traditional vegetarian food made by meat and frozen-food processors and by specialist SMEs) are the scale players [@ECO-41; @ECO-40] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Modern plant-based startups are few and very small**, and we found no disclosed institutional equity round for any Vietnamese plant-based food startup [@ECO-13; @CAP-15] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **The largest alternative-protein production asset is insect meal** (Entobel, about 11,000 t a year design capacity, the sum of two plants, our calculation) [@ECO-02; @ECO-03] {VN-direct|High}. We treat insects as a benchmark, not a recommended play.
- **Chinese fermentation by-product protein is already sold into Vietnamese feed** by a local distributor [@ECO-69] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **We found no cultivated meat or seafood company or facility in Vietnam.** The only links we found are Vietnamese corporate stakes abroad and one memorandum with no follow-up found [@ECO-58; @VCO-22] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **GFI's global company database lists 2 Vietnamese companies**, both plant-based, founded in 2019 and 2023, and no Vietnamese research actors [@VCO-21] {VN-direct|Medium}.

Rows by category in `companies.csv`: plant-based meat 18, traditional chay industrial 18, other (buyers, investors, support) 15, plant-based dairy 10, distributor 9, feed SCP or yeast 6, microalgae 5, cultivated 4, ingredient supplier 3, fermentation biomass 2, duckweed 2, insect (benchmark) 2, mushroom or mycelium 1, plant-based seafood 1 (our count of `companies.csv`; that one row, Bien Phuong, makes meat substitutes on its sources, as shown below). The groups below regroup these rows by supply role and add actors found in the retail audit ([[app-s2-retail-audit]]).

## S1.2 Incumbent soy and dairy

| Name | Location | What they do | Scale signal | Status, last verified | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vinasoy (Vietnam Soymilk Company, unit of Quang Ngai Sugar JSC, QNS) | Quang Ngai; plants in Bac Ninh (Tien Son Industrial Park) and Ho Chi Minh City (VSIP 2A, former Binh Duong) | Fami and Vinasoy soy milks; Veyo nut milks | Soy-milk revenue above VND 4,100 bn in 2024 (about USD 158 million at VND 26,000 per USD, our calculation), about 80% of soy milk, gross margin above 39%; 390 million L a year in three plants (2022) | Active. 2025 capacity not found in wave 2 | [@ECO-41; @ECO-42; @IND-48; @IND-49; @IND-50; @VCO-17; @FTR-16] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Vinamilk (plant-based lines) | Ho Chi Minh City | Nut, oat and soy milks (some blended with fresh milk), pea-protein "high-protein" milk, plant yoghurt, plant creamer | 17 SKU rows in the retail audit; nut milk reported "double-digit growth" in Q1 2026 (no figure) | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-43; @ECO-44; @FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| TH Group (TH true NUT) | Nghe An (farm) | Walnut, macadamia and almond milks with dates (oat as an ingredient); walnut variant contains fresh cow milk | Launched 17 March 2018; walnut variant 1 g protein per 100 ml | Active (wave 1); a hybrid, not fully plant-based | [@ECO-45; @ECO-40] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Nutifood (plant milks) | Ho Chi Minh City | Brown rice and corn milks | On shelf at VND 24,800 (6 Sep 2026) | Field observation only | [@ECO-40] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| ToFu House | Hung Yen (Van Giang) | Industrial tofu; pilot domestic soybean fields | Capacity of 150 to 500 t of tofu a month (2023); ISO 22000 | Active as of 2023 | [@FORM-36; @IND-51] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| My Hoa tofu-skin craft village | Vinh Long (former Binh Minh town, former Vinh Long province) | *Tàu hũ ky* (tofu skin) from mainly imported soybeans | 27 households, over 200 workers, about 7 t a day | National intangible heritage (2022) | [@FORM-14] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Tofu brands on shelf (Song Long, Pulmuone, Tafu, Ichiban) | not verified | Fresh tofu | One or two SKU rows each | On shelf September 2026 | [@FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Low} |

Readings. Vinasoy is the largest soy-milk maker in Vietnam, and it runs on imported soybeans [@ECO-41] {VN-direct|Medium}. The soy-milk share figures are company or press-reported, not audited: 82.7% (December 2014) and about 80% (2024) [@ECO-42; @ECO-41] {VN-direct|Medium}. TH true NUT and several Vinamilk products blend plant and dairy, which blurs the boundary of "plant-based" [@ECO-45; @ECO-43] {VN-direct|Medium}.

## S1.3 Industrial chay makers

These firms make *đồ chay* at industrial scale. Label evidence splits their products into two types: vegetable-filler chay (dumplings, spring rolls: mostly jicama, taro, mung bean and mushroom, with little protein) and protein-analogue chay (mock meats, canned slices: soy protein, TVP, tofu skin and wheat gluten) [@ECO-33; @FORM-01] {VN-direct|High}. We found no manufacturer that publishes chay tonnage (our search) [@ECO-25; @IND-53] {VN-direct|Medium}.

| Name | Location | What they do | Scale signal | Status, last verified | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| VISSAN (Vietnam Livestock Technology JSC) | Ho Chi Minh City (420 No Trang Long, former Binh Thanh district) | Meat processor with 8 chay SKUs, including chay dumplings and wontons launched 27 August 2026; canned chay slices | Whole-company 2026 target of 20,350 t processed food (all lines) | Active (wave 2).

| Thoai An Trading Co., Ltd | Ho Chi Minh City (Tan Tao Industrial Park, former Binh Tan district) | Tofu-skin rolls, chay sausages, chay seafood (shrimp cake, "seafood tofu") | Founded 2005; HACCP; nationwide distribution claimed | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-27; @FORM-26] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| An Nhien Foods (Pham Gia Phat Trading and Import-Export Co., Ltd) | Ho Chi Minh City (Hiep Thanh ward, former District 12) | Soy and barley TVP chay meats, dried slices, frozen meals | 12 SKU rows, the broadest modern-chay range in the audit; brand from late 2014; Halal; exports claimed to Korea, Europe, North America | Active (wave 2). Registered as a trader; no factory or capacity disclosed | [@VCO-26; @ECO-28; @FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| GN Foods JSC | Tay Ninh (former Long An): Long Hau Extended Industrial Park, Can Giuoc commune | Frozen Vietnamese foods; co-packer of a Co.op Select chay line | Founded 2009; 2,000 staff; factory 20,415 m2, processing plant 35,107 m2; BRCGS, ISO 22000, HACCP, Halal, BAP | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-35; @FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Cholimex Food JSC | Ho Chi Minh City (Vinh Loc Industrial Park, former Binh Chanh district) | Sauces and seasonings including chay kits; frozen spring rolls, dumplings and buns (bun filling with soy flour and chay ribs) | Chay bun label 5.74 g protein per 100 g | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-37; @FORM-27; @FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| LC Foods JSC | Ho Chi Minh City (Rach Bap Industrial Park, Tay Nam ward, former Binh Duong) | Chay spring rolls using TVP granules 4-7 mm | Tax code 3702777811 | Found in the retail audit; registry look-up failed in wave 2 | [@FORM-28] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Agrex Saigon Foodstuffs JSC (Top V, AS Food) | Ho Chi Minh City (former District 7) | Export dumplings and dim sum, including one chay mushroom dumpling | Volumes not disclosed | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-36] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Thanh Dung (Thuc pham chay Thanh Dung) | Ho Chi Minh City (Thuan An, former Binh Duong) | Chay maker listing TVP among products; raw materials imported from USA, Australia and Canada | Tax code 3702548219; founded 2009 | Company site only; whether it extrudes or repacks TVP is unknown | [@FORM-35] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Xuan Hong (dried chay slices brand) | not identified | Dried soy and gluten slices | One SKU at 65.2 g protein per 100 g dry | Owner and plant unknown; brand site unreachable | [@FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Directory-only SMEs: Vegan 24H, Happy Farm, Vuong Ngoc Vegan | Hanoi; Ho Chi Minh City; Tay Ninh | Mock meats, tofu products, dried chay foods | Directory listings only | Not verified | [@ECO-38] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Other chay brands on shelf: P.G.P, Vifon (chay noodles), Saky Foods, MANI, Hue One Food, Song Huong Foods | various | Chay cakes, noodles, pastries, buns, frozen chay sausages and fish cakes | One or two SKU rows each | Owners mostly not verified; P.G.P not identified | [@FORM-01; @ECO-40] {VN-direct\|Low} |

> **Correction.** The wave 1 ecosystem directory listed LC Foods as a lead "not found" (row CO-046). The retail audit found LC Foods JSC with a product page naming TVP granules and a plant in Rach Bap Industrial Park, Ho Chi Minh City (former Binh Duong) [@FORM-28] {VN-direct|High}. The same company page gives its tax code, 3702777811 [@FORM-28] {VN-direct|Medium}; a registry look-up in wave 2 failed. The directory row should be read with this correction.

> **Correction.** A prior lead named "Xuan Hong" as an industrial chay maker. The Xuan Hong found by the ecosystem research is a cassava starch processor in Tay Ninh (former Tay Ninh), with a capacity of 100 t of starch a day (2020); police recorded a violation in December 2020 for bypassing wastewater treatment [@ECO-39] {VN-direct|Medium}. A different "Xuan Hong" dried-slice brand is on shelf, owner not identified [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Low}. The two should not be merged (logged in [[app-r2-disagreements]]).

Readings:

- **Meat processors are the scale chay makers.** VISSAN, CJ Foods Vietnam, Cholimex and SG Food sell chay in the same frozen categories as meat [@IND-53; @FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. They are the most plausible co-packers for new plant-based products, with GN Foods for retailer private labels.
- **The protein-dense specialists are in Ho Chi Minh City** (An Nhien, Au Lac, Thoai An; the Xuan Hong brand's location is not verified) [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. They are the natural first customers for a domestic TVP or gluten substitute ([[app-s2-retail-audit]], section S2.13).
- **Many small makers exist beyond the brands seen.** A 2022 to 2023 food-safety survey covered 126 vegetarian food production, processing and trading establishments in Hanoi alone [@FORM-37] {VN-direct|Medium}.

## S1.4 Modern plant-based brands made in Vietnam

| Name | Location | What they do | Scale signal | Status, last verified | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cay De Food Company (VMEAT) | Ho Chi Minh City (assumed) | Plant-based burger patties, mince, *chả lụa*, ham | VND 3 bn invested from 2018; retail VND 164,000 to 445,000 per kg (2022) | No evidence after 2022 | [@ECO-17; @ECO-19] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Bien Phuong | not known | Plant-based meat substitutes | Entered mid-2020 | No evidence after 2022 | [@ECO-17; @ECO-19] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| NutriGreen Food JSC | Ho Chi Minh City (former District 10) | Plant-based meat substitutes (soy, rice, coconut) | No scale data | Website did not resolve on 23 Sep 2026 | [@ECO-25] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Vinamit JSC (jackfruit "vegan meat") | Ho Chi Minh City (not verified) | Young-jackfruit meat for export; a low-protein texturiser (our inference) | No volume found | Corporate active; jackfruit line status unknown | [@ECO-17; @ECO-18] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Is It Meat? | Ho Chi Minh City | Nuggets, sausages, schnitzels for restaurants | Sold via restaurants (2022) | Unknown; single blog source | [@ECO-15] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Yukino Foods | Ho Chi Minh City (Thao Dien) | Gyoza, falafel, burgers | One shop plus online (2022) | Unknown; claims unverified | [@ECO-15] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Kashew Cheese | Ho Chi Minh City | Fermented cashew cheeses, yoghurt, milk | Founded 2020; several deli cafes; 3 SKU rows in the audit | Active (wave 1) | [@ECO-49; @ECO-50; @FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

We found no Vietnamese plant-based egg product; a 2022 list of 12 brands includes none [@ECO-15] {VN-direct|Low}. The only plant-protein fundraising found is Emmay's (section S1.6). Press estimates of the Vietnamese plant-based meat market ("about VND 1,000 bn" in 2022; "USD 500 million within several years" in 2024) give no traceable basis and are not used [@ECO-17; @ECO-18] {VN-direct|Low}.

## S1.5 Imported brands and their channels

Imported "modern" brands entered mostly through restaurants and gourmet shops; some also reached AEON Citi Mart and K-Market. Importers distribute some brands (Classic Fine Foods for Next Meats), but we found no national distributor for any of them [@ECO-15; @ECO-16] {VN-direct|Medium}. Mintel's database logged no plant-based meat launches in Vietnam from 2022 to Q2 2023 [@ECO-23] {VN-direct|High}.

**Brands**

| Brand (origin) | Vietnam entry and channel | Scale or price signal | Status, last verified | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Oatly (Sweden), MilkLab and Alternative Dairy Co (Australia), Almond Breeze (USA), So Good | Specialty and mainstream supermarkets | 1 to 4 SKU rows each | On shelf September 2026 | [@FORM-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Dairy-Free Down Under (Australia) | Annam Gourmet, Nam An, The Food Shop (2022) | n/a | Unknown in 2026 | [@ECO-15] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| INNOHAS (South Korea) | VinaCapital Ventures investment (July 2024) to enter Vietnam | Undisclosed | No Vietnam launch found; company site does not mention Vietnam (23 Sep 2026) | [@ECO-65; @VCO-31] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Impossible Foods, Zhenmeat | No evidence of a Vietnam launch | n/a | Absence of evidence only (our search) | none (our search) {general\|Low} |
| Nestle Harvest Gourmet | No evidence of Vietnam sale | n/a | harvestgourmet.com redirects to a domain-for-sale page (23 Sep 2026) | [@VCO-25] {general\|Low} |

> **Correction.** The wave 1 directory could not identify "Unconventional" (row CO-018). The Ho Chi Minh City retail audit found two Unconventional SKUs, labelled as made in Italy and built on SPC, SPI and textured soy [@FORM-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. The owner is believed to be Gruppo Veronesi (not verified). It is the only extruded "modern" analogue on the shelves we saw.

| Vinaorganic | not known | Advertises tempeh technology transfer | unknown | Search listing only; not read | none (lead) {VN-direct\|Low} |

Emmay is the only Vietnamese startup found claiming mycelium technology; its "1,000 t in 14 days" statement is a capacity claim, not output [@ECO-12; @ECO-13] {VN-direct|Low}. Ong Tempeh is the only commercial tempeh maker we verified in our searches, and its starter sales make it a small domestic node of fungal fermentation know-how [@ECO-51] {VN-direct|Medium}. We found no commercial koji, mycoprotein or precision-fermentation producer in our searches {VN-direct|Low}.

## S1.7 Microalgae and duckweed

| Name | Location | What they do | Scale signal | Status, last verified | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spirulina Vinh Hao JSC | Lam Dong (former Binh Thuan): Vinh Hao commune, Tuy Phong | Spirulina powder and tablets, grown on Vinh Hao mineral water | Over 12,000 m2 of ponds (undated company page); nearly 17 t a year (a 2013 figure) | Active (wave 1); site chosen 1976, company 2008 | [@ECO-52] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

| FiBL and Binca Seafoods duckweed project | not known | Duckweed for aquafeed pilot (2019, prior lead) | Outcome unpublished | Lead not verified | none (lead) {VN-direct\|Low} |

Readings. The two spirulina producers with scale data (Vinh Hao and VN Vastcom) sell health food at high prices; neither is a bulk protein supplier [@ECO-52; @ECO-53] {VN-direct|Medium}. One source claims more than 70% of spirulina products sold in Vietnam are imported [@ECO-53] {VN-direct|Low}. We found no national output total. We found no commercial duckweed, seaweed-protein or koji producer in our searches {VN-direct|Low}. Spirulina producers were not re-checked in wave 2.

> **Correction.** Wave 1 recorded Vedan's glutamic acid capacity as 36,000 t a year (the 1995 figure). The last published nameplate is 180,000 t a year, set in 2004; neither figure is confirmed as current [@VCO-03] {VN-direct|Medium}.

Readings:

- **The import counterfactual for a Vietnamese single-cell protein already exists.** Chinese single-cell biomass from glutamic acid production is offered to Vietnamese feed formulators through CK Vietnam / V-Group [@ECO-69] {VN-direct|Medium}. The name "mycoprotein" is probably a misnomer here: glutamic acid is usually made by bacterial fermentation, so the product is likely bacterial, not fungal (our inference).
- **The large aerobic fermenters are captive.** Vedan, Ajinomoto (Dong Nai) and Daesang (Phu Tho) run single-product lines, and we found no toll-fermentation offer from any of them [@IND-01; @IND-08; @IND-11] {VN-direct|Low}. Ajinomoto's permitted MSG capacity at Bien Hoa is 150,000 t a year (2023 environmental assessment, reported in press) [@IND-08] {VN-direct|Medium}. See [[app-s5-facilities]].
- **Vedan's fertiliser and feed segment is, in our reading, an existing fermentation by-product feed business** that could price-benchmark single-cell protein [@VCO-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. Vedan reports that cassava prices rose sharply from Q4 2025 through H1 2026 [@VCO-02] {VN-adjacent|High}.

## S1.9 Insect protein (benchmark)

| Name | Location | What they do | Scale signal | Status, last verified | Sources |

| Entobel (Entobel Holding Pte Ltd, Singapore; Belgian founders) | Dong Nai (1,000 t a year, since 2019); Ho Chi Minh City (former Ba Ria-Vung Tau), Dat Do I Industrial Park (10,000 t a year, opened 23 Nov 2023) | Black soldier fly larvae meal (H-Meal, at least 53% crude protein), oil (H-Oil), frass (H-Ferti); feedstock includes HEINEKEN Vietnam by-products | Design capacity about 11,000 t a year of meal (sum of the two plants); more than 200 staff (2026); USD 32.5 million project financing | Active (wave 2). B Corp (5 Feb 2025); no output, feedstock or Indonesia update published | [@ECO-01; @ECO-02; @ECO-03; @VCO-18; @VCO-19; @CAP-02] {VN-direct\|High} |
| Cricket One | Dong Nai (former Binh Phuoc), Loc Ninh area; Ho Chi Minh City office | Cricket powders, whole crickets, oil, restructured cricket meat, frass | 4 company farms and about 20 satellite farms; 1,000 t a year processing capacity (2023, claimed) with a 10,000 t target; exports to EU, North America, Japan; HACCP, FSSC 22000 | Active as of October 2024 (last evidence); site timed out in wave 2 | [@ECO-07; @ECO-08; @ECO-09; @ECO-10; @ECO-11] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| HEINEKEN Vietnam | Ho Chi Minh City | Supplies brewery by-products to Entobel | Volumes not disclosed | Named as a feedstock supplier (November 2023); current status not verified | [@ECO-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

Entobel is the benchmark incumbent for any novel feed protein. Key terms:

- **Protein output at full capacity.** At the 53% minimum crude protein, 11,000 t a year of meal is about 5,800 t of protein a year at full capacity (our calculation: 11,000 x 0.53) [@ECO-04; @ECO-03] {VN-direct|Low}. Actual output is not disclosed.
- **Offtake.** Vinh Hoan agreed in February 2024 to buy at least 15,000 t of Entobel insect protein over 2025 to 2027, about 5,000 t a year or about 45% of design capacity (our calculation) [@ECO-05] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **First commercial insect-meal shrimp feed.** Skretting Vietnam and Entobel announced a strategic partnership on 26 November 2025; commercial production of Skretting shrimp feed containing H-Meal began that month (company claim; no inclusion rate or volume disclosed) [@VCO-28] {VN-direct|Medium}.
- **Financing.** See the correction below and [[app-s11-capital]].

> **Correction.** Earlier drafts gave Entobel's financing as about USD 36 million. The documented structure is a USD 32.5 million project: Mekong Capital USD 25 million, Dragon Capital USD 5 million and IFC USD 2.5 million under an "Upstream Collaboration Agreement" (IFC project 46903, board date 23 February 2023) [@CAP-01; @CAP-02; @VCO-20] {VN-direct|Medium}. The company describes a USD 33 million Series B [@ECO-01] {VN-direct|Low}. Earlier rounds are undisclosed.

Cricket One volume claims use different units (crickets per month, fresh tonnes, live tonnes) and are all company claims; we use the 1,000 t a year processing capacity (2023) as the scale anchor [@ECO-07; @ECO-09; @ECO-10; @ECO-11] {VN-direct|Low}.

We found no cultivated meat or seafood company, facility or university group in Vietnam [@ECO-64; @ECO-72] {VN-direct|Medium}. The only cultivated project for Vietnamese soil we found is the 2022 Minh Phu MOU, with no sign it proceeded [@VCO-22] {VN-direct|Medium}. Vinh Hoan has both invested in an alternative-protein startup and signed a feed offtake [@ECO-05; @ECO-58] {VN-direct|Medium}.

## S1.11 Feed majors as buyers

Feed mills are the B2B buyers that decide whether a novel feed protein has a market. Six firms (Sheng Long/Haid, C.P., Uni-President, Tongwei, Grobest, Gromax) supplied about 640 kt of shrimp feed in 2025, about 70% of the total [@IND-41] {VN-direct|Medium}. Detail on volumes and prices is in [[app-s6-feed-market]].

Royal De Heus announced the purchase of CJ Feed & Care on 1 October 2025 and completed it on 3 March 2026; the deal covered 17 feed mills in total across Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, South Korea and the Philippines. The Vietnam share was not disclosed [@VCO-07; @VCO-08] {VN-direct|High}. The Vinh Long marine mill has a design capacity of 168,000 t a year in the company announcement [@VCO-10] and 84,000 t a year in trade press [@IND-45], probably a first phase; we use the company figure {VN-direct|Medium}.

## S1.12 Ingredient suppliers and distributors

| Name | Location | What they supply | Evidence | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VAL (Vietnam Agribusiness Co., Ltd; Bunge-Wilmar joint venture) | Ho Chi Minh City (former Ba Ria-Vung Tau): Phu My 1 Industrial Park | Soybean meal (feed) and oil | 2.6 Mt of soybeans a year and nearly 2 Mt of meal after a USD 100 million second line (December 2025); expected by Ho Chi Minh City officials to supply about 30% of domestic soybean meal; no food-grade line on record | [@VCO-16; @FORM-10] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| VMC Group (Phu Gia Viet My) | Hanoi head office; claims 19 branches; Da Nang branch | China-origin SPI (20 kg bags); Xinrui (China) wheat gluten (25 kg bags, Da Nang) | Distributor pages | [@FORM-11; @FORM-13; @FORM-39] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

| Vedan Vietnam | Dong Nai | Glucose syrup and starch sold to third parties | Nameplates 1994 to 2004 (see S1.8) | [@VCO-03; @IND-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |

The pattern is clear: concentrated plant proteins are largely imported in bags through chemical and food-additive distributors (some of China origin), and domestic soybean crushing (four plants) is feed-grade, with no food-grade flake line found [@FORM-11; @FORM-12; @VCO-16; @FORM-09] {VN-direct|Medium}. See [[app-s2-retail-audit]], section S2.10, for trade volumes.

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said the only domestic soybean processor is a feed-grade crusher and that concentrated plant proteins arrive from China; USDA reports four crushing plants (one in the north, three in the south), all feed-grade on our evidence, and only some distributor listings state China origin.
