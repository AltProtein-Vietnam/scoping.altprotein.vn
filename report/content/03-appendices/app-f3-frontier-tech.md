# F3. Frontier technology: evidence, costs and windows

**What this appendix contains.** The detail behind [[ch21-frontier-technology]]: an evidence card for each of eleven frontier routes (F3.1); the arithmetic for protein made from renewable power in Vietnam (F3.2); learning rates and cost paths (F3.3); carbon prices and carbon cost per tonne of protein (F3.4); AI and bio-design (F3.5); approvals and capital (F3.6); the research pipeline (F3.7); and the windows table (F3.8).

**How to use it.** Read a route's card before pricing a deal or programme in it. Test any cost claim against F3.2 and F3.3. Use F3.8 for the condition that opens each window, and [[app-f2-drivers-signals]] for the signposts.

> **Method note.** Global cost paths are published models. Vietnamese costs are our calculations from three rerunnable scripts in `working-papers/wave3/`: `frontier_gas/ftg_estimates.py`, `econ_policy/ecf_calc.py` and `next_gen_feedstocks/ngf_calc.py`. The prices to beat are fishmeal protein at USD 2,625 (2025 average) to 3,846 (August 2026) per t and soybean-meal protein at about USD 880 per t [@FM-01] {general|High}. Every window is an estimate with conditions, not a forecast. Tags: [[app-m2-futures-method]].

## F3.1 Frontier map: one card per route

Each card gives the status in 2026, the largest plant, cost evidence, failures, Vietnam's base, the window and its conditions. Full registers: `frontier_gas_tech.csv`, `frontier_bio_tech.csv`, `feedstock_futures.csv`.

### F3.1.1 Power-to-protein (hydrogen-oxidising bacteria)

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | Food grade at technology readiness level (TRL) 7, approved in Singapore (2022), US notice filed May 2026; feed grade TRL 5 to 6 with no plant (TRLs our judgement) [@FTG-01; @FTG-03; @RGN-04] {general\|Medium} |
| Largest plant | Solar Foods, Finland: Factory 01, scaling to 230 t a year. Phase one of Factory 02 (3,200 t a year) targets late 2028; the investment decision was pending in September 2026 [@FTG-04; @FTG-05] {general\|Medium} {fx:signal} |
| Cost evidence | EUR 4.0 to 4.5 per kg of protein (2030) and 2.1 to 2.3 (2050) at the best global sites [@FTG-01] {general\|High} {fx:projection} (Fasihi et al. published model). The 3,200 t plan implies about EUR 60,000 per annual t of product on the EUR 191 million on-balance-sheet budget (about EUR 99,000 with EUR 127 million of partner finance), several times the model's first-plant capex (our derivation) [@FTG-03; @FTG-04] {general\|Low}. Vietnam: F3.2.4 |
| Failures | NovoNutrients closed in 2025 on capital intensity, and Arkeon became insolvent in 2025 after it could not close a funding round; Solar Foods made an operating loss of EUR 6.8 million in H1 2026 [@FTG-10; @FTG-11; @FTG-03] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | 2 of 494 papers (2016 to 2026); no project [@FTG-14] {VN-direct\|High} |
| Window | Bulk feed 2040 to 2045 at the earliest {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | The five conditions in F3.2.6 |

{{kn:kn-vn-gas-protein-papers}}

### F3.1.2 Methane and steel-gas protein

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | Methane protein TRL 8, approved for Chinese aquafeed (2024); steel-gas protein (*Clostridium autoethanogenum* protein, CAP) TRL 9 in China as an ethanol co-product, certified in 2021 (TRLs our judgement) [@FTG-06; @FTG-22] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |
| Largest plant | Calysseo, Chongqing: 20,000 t a year, halted in 2026. Shougang LanzaTech made 10,200 t of protein in 2023, at 0.1 to 0.15 t per t of ethanol [@FTG-06; @FM-13; @FTG-08; @FTG-09] {VN-adjacent\|Medium}. Unibio plans 50,000 t in Saudi Arabia from 2028, with Asia as a target market [@FTG-07] {general\|Medium} {fx:signal} |
| Cost evidence | One model: USD 1.10 to 2.57 per kg of protein [@FTG-25] {general\|Low}. Our arithmetic: 1.7 kg of methane per kg of protein x 0.0526 MMBtu per kg = 0.089 MMBtu; at USD 8 to 14 per MMBtu (the top is MOIT's 2026 LNG basis) the gas alone costs USD 720 to 1,250 per t of protein, about the whole price of soybean-meal protein [@FTG-31] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Failures | Calysseo: 2025 revenue USD 0.71 million, loss USD 15.5 million, loan not renewed; earlier gas-based protein proved uneconomic because of the high price of natural gas; Shougang LanzaTech (CAP) had a minus 9.2% gross margin in H1 2024 [@FTG-06; @FTG-26; @FTG-08] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | No project. At Hoa Phat, in-house power from recovered waste heat and steel-mill gas covers 80 to 90% of site electricity use, so the gas has a power value [@FTG-20] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Imported methane or CAP protein from about 2028; a CAP-type co-product only inside a steel-gas ethanol or aviation-fuel project, 2030s {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | Methane below about USD 5 per MMBtu; a feed-list entry; shrimp-feed buyers paying for function {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.3 Biomass fermentation on sugar and side streams

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | TRL 8 to 9; China approved mycoprotein for food in 2025 [@HSC-11] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |
| Largest plant | Angel Yeast, 11,000 t a year of yeast protein (November 2025); Cabio with Nourish, about 170,000 t of finished-product capacity [@HSC-14; @HSC-13] {VN-adjacent\|Medium}. Enifer is building a 3,000 t PEKILO plant (Finland) and a 500 t pilot on ethanol stillage in Brazil [@NGF-17] {general\|Medium} {fx:signal} |
| Cost evidence | Vietnamese fungal feed protein USD 4,050 to 14,700 per t of protein at 2026 prices ([[ch09-economics]]); floor and cost paths in F3.3.2. A plant costing USD 100 million in the US costs about USD 15 million in China (interviewees' rule of thumb) [@HSC-13] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |
| Failures | Meati (US mycoprotein) failed in 2025 despite commercial output [@FTB-38] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | Thai Duong Feed JSC's 2016 to 2019 research project made yeast protein from cereals and molasses (dry product above 46% protein): 120 t of liquid product; VND 167 billion total investment; status now unknown [@HSC-06; @HSC-07] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Feed single-cell protein 2027 to 2030; food mycoprotein 2030 to 2035 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | An aquafeed-list entry for microbial biomass and one anchor mill; a new-food route for food {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.4 Precision fermentation

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | High-value proteins TRL 8 to 9; dairy and egg proteins TRL 7 to 8 (TRLs our judgement). Four or more US "no questions" letters in 2025, one for a Chinese firm; approvals in F3.6.1 [@FTB-17; @FTB-18; @FTB-19] {general\|Medium} |
| Largest plant | Not disclosed in our sources |
| Cost evidence | Targets only, no model outputs (F3.3.4); economic now for high-value proteins such as lactoferrin (USD 750 to 1,500 per kg) [@FTB-23; @FTB-41] {general\|Medium} |
| Failures | Patent disputes over strains and proteins (Onego Bio and VTT, The EVERY Company, Fonterra, Perfect Day, Impossible Foods, Motif) [@FTB-17] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | 2 indexed papers (2015 to 2025); we found no food-grade contract fermentation; Decree 43/2026 sets first rules for genetically modified microbes in closed production [@HSC-01; @AQF-22] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Contract manufacture of high-value proteins 2030 to 2035; commodity dairy and egg proteins 2035 to 2040 at the earliest {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | A first closed-production GMO certificate; clearance by reliance on US or Singapore decisions; regional food-grade contract capacity above 10 m3; patent expiries (F3.6.3) {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.5 AI-assisted bio-design and biofoundries

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | Media and process optimisation TRL 6 to 7; generative design of food proteins TRL 4 to 6; autonomous biofoundries TRL 5 to 6 (our judgement) [@FTB-04; @FTB-06; @FTB-08] {general\|Medium} |
| Largest facility | The acceleration results came from biofoundries (iBioFAB, Illinois), not from software alone [@FTB-05; @FTB-06] {general\|High} |
| Cost evidence | 1.6 to 30 times fewer experiments; no lower production cost at scale shown (F3.5.1) {general\|High} |
| Failures and limits | Adoption "far below the ceiling"; open data is "the binding constraint" [@FTB-01] {general\|High} |
| Vietnam base | Top-40 AI compute; no biofoundry (F3.5.2) {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Design now to 2030; domestic build-and-test 2030 to 2035 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | A lab with a reliable assay and data scientists; access to a regional biofoundry; open data for public projects {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.6 Cellulosic (second-generation) sugar

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | TRL 7 to 8, but no plant has run reliably at design output. Every US and European commercial cellulosic ethanol plant has shut, the last being Clariant's Podari plant (63 million litres a year, USD 258 million) in December 2023 [@NGF-33; @NGF-34] {general\|High} |
| India's first commercial plant | Panipat, India (about 200,000 t of straw a year): next to no output in year one, 62% of design in December 2025; work on 12 planned second-generation refineries was reported paused (November 2024); Numaligarh (185 kilolitres of ethanol a day, bamboo) opened in September 2025 [@NGF-10; @NGF-11] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |
| Cost evidence | Mature-plant models USD 342 (with co-product credits) to 467 (converted from USD 0.212 per lb) per t of sugar; a lab-optimised Indian bagasse process USD 1,320 [@NGF-06; @NGF-07; @NGF-08] {general\|Medium}; Vietnamese cassava glucose about USD 511 to 560 (our derivation from native starch at USD 520 to 540 FOB, April 2026) [@FS-11] {VN-direct\|Low}. First plants: USD 2,090 (Panipat) to 2,380 (Podari) per t of annual sugar capacity, about USD 3,400 per delivered t at 62% use (our derivation) {general\|Low} |
| Failures | As above. Not low-carbon by default: 1.57 kg CO2e per kg of bagasse sugar against 0.60 to 0.97 for Thai cassava starch [@NGF-08; @ECF-25] {general\|Low} |
| Vietnam base | No plant or pilot found; enzyme costs still named as the barrier (June 2026); about 52 Mt of straw a year (our 2025 estimate), 30% of Mekong straw collected [@NGF-31; @NGF-01; @NGF-04] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Modest scale in the 2040s {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | An Asian straw-sugar plant above 80% of design for two years and a traded straw price (our assumptions); full straw collection on the 1 million ha rice programme by 2030 [@NTS-32] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} (official target) |

Scale (our calculation, `ngf_calc.py`): the 2050 S-ALT sugar need of 1.32 Mt of glucose would take 3.0 to 4.3 Mt of straw (6 to 10% of national straw) and USD 2.8 to 4.5 billion of first-generation plants, 15 to 21 of Panipat's size {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Feedstock cases: [[app-f6-aquafeed-feedstock-futures]].

### F3.1.7 One-carbon (methanol) routes

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | Methanol-fed *Pichia pastoris* at pilot scale in China: 0.43 g of biomass per g of methanol at 50.6% protein, about 4.6 t of methanol per t of protein [@NGF-13] {VN-adjacent\|Medium}; electro-microbial routes TRL 3 to 4 [@FTG-12; @FTG-13] {general\|Low} |
| Largest plant | A "10,000 t class" Chinese demonstration is referred to but not verified [@FTG-24] {VN-adjacent\|Low} |
| Cost evidence | e-methanol USD 800 to 2,400 per t today; USD 250 to 630 per t in 2050 (USD 287 to 724 per t of sugar equivalent) [@NGF-12] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} (IRENA published model). Vietnam: USD 785 to 1,112 per t of sugar equivalent at 2026 hydrogen costs, USD 495 to 695 at USD 1.5 to 2 per kg of hydrogen, about cassava-glucose parity (our calculation) {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Failures | ICI's Pruteen was discontinued for financial reasons [@FTG-01] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | BSR at Dung Quat (Quang Ngai) plans to study low-carbon methanol from biogenic CO2 from the fourth quarter of 2026 [@FS-09]; we found no methanol-protein work {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Window | 2040s, at modest scale {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | Hydrogen at USD 1.5 to 2 per kg; a Chinese feed certificate for methanol protein {VN-direct\|Low} |

Our calculation for 2050: supplying the S-ALT sugar need through methanol takes about 1.5 Mt of methanol, 0.29 Mt of green hydrogen (1.5 to 2.9% of the 2050 target) and about 16 TWh; about 49 MWh per t of protein, below direct hydrogen fermentation but with heavy cooling {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F3.1.8 Cultivated meat and seafood

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | Meat TRL 6 to 7, seafood 5 to 6 (our judgement); seven companies cleared by 2025 in Singapore, the US, Australia and New Zealand; Singapore cleared cultivated beef (4 August 2026); no EU authorisation [@FTB-24; @HSC-12; @FTB-45] {general\|Medium} |

| Cost evidence | From USD 2.3 million per kg (2013) to about USD 63 per kg [@FTB-27]; media claims of USD 0.20 per litre [@FTB-24] against a peer-reviewed, industry-funded USD 0.63 [@FTB-01] {general\|Low}. 1% of world meat would need about 30 times the 2021 world culture capacity; pharmaceutical-grade media give 4 to 25 times beef's emissions [@FTB-26] {general\|High} |
| Failures | Believer Meats shut in December 2025 after FDA clearance; firms fell from 155 to 142; investment from about USD 1 billion (2021) to 73.9 million (2025) [@FTB-24; @FTB-45; @FTB-01] {general\|Medium} |
| Forecasts | A 54% chance (2021 forecaster panel) that world output stays below 100,000 t a year through 2051 [@HSC-18] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} (published probabilistic forecast); hybrids "may reach foodservice price points first within the decade" (published December 2025, so by about 2030 to 2035) [@FTB-44] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} (published review) |
| Vietnam base | 1 indexed paper (legal); VAST characterised bovine stem cells in 2025 [@HSC-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Research only to 2035; seafood cells from Vietnamese species in the 2040s {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | A food-grade fish or shrimp cell line; peer-reviewed media below about USD 0.5 per litre; a novel-food route with reliance {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.9 Molecular farming

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status 2026 | TRL 5 to 7; US plant-pest clearances in 2024 for soybean with pork proteins and pea with bovine myoglobin; no completed FDA food review found [@FTB-29; @FTB-31] {general\|Medium} |
| Cost evidence | About 50 to 300 kg of target protein per ha (our estimate: soybean at 1.5 to 3.5 t per ha x 38% protein x 80% soluble x 26.6% target, a company claim; maize myoglobin about 48 kg per ha) [@FTB-28] {general\|Low} |
| Failures | Moolec merged into Bioceres entities, one of over 40 sector closures and deals in 2024 to 2025 [@FTB-32] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base | GM maize grown since 2015; duckweed germplasm; no project; 0 papers [@FTB-34; @HSC-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Window | Contained hosts for heme, enzymes or growth factors, 2035 to 2045 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Conditions | A biosafety route under Decree 43/2026; a first foreign food approval {VN-direct\|Low} |

### F3.1.10 Cell-free protein synthesis

| Vietnam base | None; low-cost teaching kits exist [@FTB-37] {general\|Medium} |
| Window | Prototyping now; bulk food not before 2050 {general\|Medium} {fx:wildcard} |

### F3.1.11 Algal and oilseed omega-3 (brief)

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Status | Commercial: a USD 200 million algal-oil plant (2019); omega-3 canola oil replaced all fish oil in low-fishmeal shrimp diets [@AQF-23; @AQF-19] {general\|Medium} |
| Vietnam base and window | Buyer only; 2026 to 2035 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate}. Detail in [[app-f6-aquafeed-feedstock-futures]] |

## F3.2 Power-to-protein in Vietnam: the arithmetic

Script: `ftg_estimates.py`. Results in F3.2.2 to F3.2.6 are our calculations {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F3.2.1 Inputs

| Input | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Electricity per t of protein | 2030 design: 69.3 MWh on baseload, 73 to 83 MWh generated from solar and wind (electrolysers 54 to 56%); 2050 design: 60.9 and 64 to 70 MWh | [@FTG-01] {general\|High} {fx:projection} (published model) |
| Hydrogen, CO2, ammonia per t of protein | 0.69 t (0.451 kg per kg of dry cells at 65% protein); 2.95 t; 0.24 t | [@FTG-01] {general\|High} |
| Capacity factors, Vietnam | Solar 17%; offshore wind 43 to 51.4% | [@FTG-19] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Solar farm density | 75 to 109 MW per km2 | [@FTG-01] {general\|Medium} |
| Plans for 2050 | Electricity 1,360 to 1,511 TWh; solar 293 to 296 GW; 240 GW of offshore wind for hydrogen and ammonia; power-sector emissions about 27 Mt (197 to 199 Mt in 2030) | [@FTG-15] {VN-direct\|High} {fx:projection} (official target) |
| Clean hydrogen targets | 100 to 500 kt (2030); 10 to 20 Mt (2050); no cost target | [@FTG-16] {VN-direct\|High} {fx:projection} (official target) |
| Grid factor | 0.6592 t CO2 per MWh (2023) | [@COST-08] {VN-direct\|High} |
| Solar cost | USD 29 to 52 per MWh (2030), 18 to 25 (2050); solar hurdle rates 12% (2030) and 8.5% (2050) | [@FTG-19] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} (BloombergNEF published model) |
| Hydrogen cost, south | USD 2.81 to 2.85 per kg (6% discount rate; we treat it as a lower bound) | [@FTG-18] {VN-direct\|Low} |

> **Correction.** In v0.6 this said solar cost USD 29 to 85 per MWh (2030) and 18 to 64 (2050), with hurdle rates of 8.5 to 16%; the source gives USD 29 to 52 (2030) and 18 to 25 (2050) for utility-scale solar, with solar hurdle rates of 12% (2030) and 8.5% (2050).

Steps: TWh = t of protein x MWh per t / 1,000,000; solar GW = TWh x 1,000,000 / (8,760 x 0.17) / 1,000; land = MW / (75 to 109).

### F3.2.2 Energy, hydrogen, CO2, land and grid carbon

| Output | Design | TWh a year | Solar GW | or offshore wind GW | Solar land, km2 | H2, Mt | CO2, Mt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 100 kt of protein | 2030 | 7.3 to 8.3 | 4.9 to 5.6 | 1.6 to 2.2 | 45 to 74 | 0.069 | 0.30 |
| 1 Mt | 2030 | 73 to 83 | 49 to 56 | 16 to 22 | 450 to 743 | 0.69 | 2.95 |
| 100 kt | 2050 | 6.4 to 7.0 | 4.3 to 4.7 | 1.4 to 1.9 | 39 to 63 | 0.069 | 0.30 |
| 1 Mt | 2050 | 64 to 70 | 43 to 47 | 14 to 19 | 394 to 627 | 0.69 | 2.95 |

The 500 kt rows are in `working-papers/wave3/frontier_gas/frontier_gas.md`. Against the plans (our calculation from [@FTG-01; @FTG-15; @FTG-16]) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}:
- **1 Mt of protein a year** takes 4.2 to 6.1% of planned 2050 electricity, 15 to 19% of the 2050 solar plan and 3.5 to 6.9% of the 2050 hydrogen target.
- **100 kt a year** would take 14 to 69% of the whole 2030 hydrogen target.
- **All the protein in 2025 soybean-meal imports** (2.62 Mt) would need 168 to 218 TWh, 113 to 146 GW of solar (38 to 50% of the 2050 plan) and 1.8 Mt of hydrogen: physically possible, economically not (F3.2.4 and F3.2.5).
- **Land:** about 13 to 22 t of protein per ha of panels, over ten times any staple crop [@FTG-02] {general|Medium}.

**Grid carbon, electricity only:** about 46 t CO2 per t of protein at the 2023 factor; 24 to 28 t at the 2030 average implied by the power plan (0.35 to 0.40 t per MWh, an upper bound); 1.1 to 1.4 t in 2050 (0.018 to 0.020), if the plan's 27 Mt cap is met {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Dedicated renewables are a precondition until about 2045.

### F3.2.3 CO2 point sources

From `co2_point_sources_vn.csv` (18 rows):

| Site (province) | Sector | CO2, t a year | Note | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dung Quat steel, Hoa Phat (Quang Ngai) | Steel | about 17,000,000 (our proxy: Dung Quat's 75% share of group crude-steel capacity applied to 22.5 Mt of group Scope 1, CO2e) | Off-gas already burned for power | [@FTG-20] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Hoa Phat, Hai Phong (former Hai Duong) and other sites | Steel | about 5,600,000 (remainder of group Scope 1 after the Dung Quat proxy) | As above | [@FTG-20] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Three ethanol plants: Dung Quat (Quang Ngai), Quang Nam ethanol (Da Nang, former Quang Nam), Dong Nai ethanol (Dong Nai) | Fuel ethanol | about 82,000, 75,000 and 50,000 (our estimate) | Fermentation CO2, over 95% pure | [@FS-09] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| An Khe ethanol, Gia Lai (planned 2028) | Fuel ethanol | about 50,000 if built | As above | [@FS-09] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Phu My (Ho Chi Minh City, former Ba Ria-Vung Tau), Ca Mau, Ha Bac (Bac Ninh, former Bac Giang) and Ninh Binh fertiliser plants | Ammonia and urea | Not found | The source lists fertiliser plants in general as concentrated CO2 sources; the plant list, CO2 use for urea and a possible surplus at coal-based plants are our knowledge and inference | [@FTG-21] {VN-direct\|Low} |

Readings {VN-direct|Low}: the three ethanol plants release about 0.21 Mt a year, less than the 0.30 Mt that 100 kt of protein needs but enough for pilots up to about 70 kt; 1 Mt of protein needs about 13% of Hoa Phat's 2025 Scope 1 emissions (22.5 Mt), but that gas already makes power; volumes at fertiliser plants, refineries and Formosa Ha Tinh are unknown.

### F3.2.4 Cost estimates for 2030, 2040 and 2050

Method: electricity use x Vietnamese supply price (solar cost x 1.4 to 1.54 for balancing, our assumption), plus the model's non-energy costs x 1.15 to 1.35 for a Vietnamese cost of capital of about 9 to 11%, against 7% in the model [@FTG-01; @FTG-19].

| Year | MWh per t of protein | Power, USD per MWh | Non-energy at 7%, USD per t | Result, USD per t of protein | Best global sites, USD per t |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2030 | 75 to 83 | 45 to 90 | 3,044 to 3,804 | 6,900 to 12,600 | 4,800 to 5,400 |
| 2040 | 70 to 78 | 32 to 70 | 2,100 to 2,340 (interpolated) | 4,700 to 8,600 | 3,720 to 4,200 (2035) |
| 2050 | 65 to 72 | 25 to 57 | 1,440 to 1,800 | 3,300 to 6,500 | 2,520 to 2,760 |

Vietnamese columns {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}; best sites {general|High} {fx:projection} (Fasihi et al. published model, EUR x 1.2). On grid power at today's USD 75 per MWh, a 2030 plant would cost USD 8,700 to 10,300 per t and emit about 46 t CO2 per t {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. In the model, cost of capital plus or minus 2 points moves cost 12 to 15%; the high electrolyser-cost case adds only 3 to 6% [@FTG-01] {general|High}.

{{kn:kn-p2p-cost-vn-2050}}

### F3.2.5 Hydrogen-price sensitivity and parity

A plant buying hydrogen pays **about USD 690 per t of protein for each USD 1 per kg of hydrogen** (0.694 t per t). At USD 1, 2, 3 and 5 per kg the hydrogen line alone is USD 694, 1,388, 2,082 and 3,469 per t of protein; at USD 2 it exceeds the whole price of soybean-meal protein {general|High}.

**Breakeven delivered hydrogen price** (point-source CO2 at USD 20 to 50 per t; non-hydrogen costs at a Vietnamese cost of capital) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}:

| Price to beat, USD per t of protein | 2030 plant costs | 2050 plant costs |
|---|---|---|
| Soybean-meal protein, 880 | None | None |
| Fishmeal protein, 2025 average, 2,625 | None | USD 1.1 per kg or less, best case only |
| 80% of August 2026 fishmeal protein, 3,077 | None | USD 1.8 per kg or less, best case only |
| Fishmeal protein, August 2026, 3,846 | About USD 0.3 per kg, best case only | USD 0.7 to 2.9 per kg |

**Parity.** The Vietnamese cost reaches the fishmeal-protein band only at its low end and only around 2050, and never approaches soybean-meal protein under published projections {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Today's Vietnamese hydrogen costs (USD 2.81 to 3.88 per kg) sit above most breakevens [@FTG-18] {VN-direct|Low}.

{{chart:chart-cost-paths-2050}}

### F3.2.6 The five conditions

> **Speculative.** Our judgement is that bulk feed protein from renewable power opens in Vietnam not before about 2040 to 2045, and only if all five conditions align {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

| Condition | Threshold (our estimate) | What sources say | Earliest it might be met |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Delivered green hydrogen | About USD 1.5 to 2 per kg or less | USD 2.81 to 3.88 today; USD 3.05 (2030) and 1.59 (2050) cited [@FTG-18] | About 2045 to 2050 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| 2. Firmed renewable power | About USD 30 to 45 per MWh or less | Solar low end USD 29 (2030), 18 (2050) before balancing [@FTG-19] | Best sites 2030s; typical sites 2040s {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:estimate} |
| 3. Capital | Plant near EUR 4,000 per annual t of protein; cost of capital about 8% or less | Model core-plant capex paths EUR 4,371 (2035, advanced scenario) and 3,702 (2050, reference scenario); solar hurdle rates 12% (2030) and 8.5% (2050) [@FTG-01; @FTG-19] | 2035 with concessional finance, else 2050 {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| 4. Price | Fishmeal protein above about USD 3,000 per t, sustained, or a carbon price on competing protein | No World Bank fishmeal forecast; carbon market excludes agriculture [@GT-14; @REG-59] | Uncertain {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| 5. Rules | Feed-list entry for bacterial biomass (MAE); new-food route (MOH) | Food Safety Law window 2026 to 2027 [@REG-12] | 2027 to 2030 {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:estimate} |

Also needed (our judgement): CO2 at USD 20 to 50 per t beside power and hydrogen (our assumed price; available now for pilots); and one hydrogen-route plant above 10 kt a year running two years abroad, not before about 2032, since the largest planned plant (3,200 t a year) targets late 2028 [@FTG-04] {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. **Earlier, narrower windows:** formulating imported, approved food ingredients from about 2028 if a new-food route exists; a CAP-type co-product in the 2030s; a 100 to 1,000 t research pilot on ethanol-plant CO2 now to 2030 {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

## F3.3 Learning rates and cost paths

### F3.3.1 Learning-rate evidence

A 20% learning rate means unit cost falls 20% each time cumulative output doubles. Full table: `learning_rates.csv` (21 rows).

| Industry | Learning rate | Period | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sugarcane ethanol, Brazil | 19% processing; 20% total cost | 1975 to 2005 | [@ECF-01; @ECF-02] {general\|Medium} |
| Corn ethanol, United States | 13% processing; 18% total cost | 1983 to 2005 | [@ECF-03] {general\|Medium} |
| Rapeseed biodiesel, Germany | 3% | 1991 to 2004 | [@ECF-02] {general\|Low} |
| Lignocellulosic ethanol, biomass diesel | 1 to 2% (bottom-up estimates, not observed) | Forward | [@ECF-02] {general\|Low} |
| Cellulosic ethanol, US planning assumption | 10 to 25% (assumed) | 2022 outlook | [@ECF-01] {general\|Low} |
| Solar, wind, batteries | Costs fell near 10% a year | Several decades | [@ECF-05] {general\|High} |
| Any alternative protein | **None found**: 9 works combine the terms (2015 to 2026), none empirical | 2015 to 2026 | [@ECF-09] {general\|Medium} |

Complex, site-built and customised plants learn more slowly than mass-produced panels and cells [@ECF-10; @ECF-11] {general|High}. We use 5 to 20% on capital cost and treat solar-style curves for fermented protein as unsupported {general|Medium} {fx:trend}. Big historic bioprocess cost falls came from titre and yield, not from building identical plants (our judgement); penicillin titres, for example, rose 225-fold in 1941 to 1944 [@ECF-06] {general|Medium}.

{{kn:kn-learning-rate-fermentation}}

### F3.3.2 Fungal feed protein: floor and planning range

Script: `ecf_calc.py`, part A. Learning applies only to capital charge and maintenance in the supply chapters' cost stack A (10,000 t a year; [[ch09-economics]]); glucose, urea, power, labour and land stay at 2026 real prices.

| Input, USD per t of product (2026) | Low-cost end | High-cost end |
|---|---|---|
| Total cost | 2,227 | 6,612 |
| Capital charge | 960 (12% a year) | 3,600 (18% a year) |
| Maintenance | 240 | 800 |
| Operating cost | 1,027 | 2,212 |
| Protein content | 55% | 45% |
| **Floor with free capital, USD per t of protein** | **1,867** | **4,916** |

| Scenario | Learning rate | Doublings of global capacity by 2030 / 2040 / 2050 | 2030 | 2040 | 2050, USD per t of protein |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Slow | 5% | 1 / 3 / 4 | 3,940 to 14,200 | 3,740 to 13,300 | 3,640 to 12,880 |
| Central | 12% | 2 / 4 / 6 | 3,560 to 12,490 | 3,180 to 10,780 | 2,880 to 9,460 |
| Fast | 20% | 3 / 6 / 8 | 2,980 to 9,920 | 2,440 to 7,480 | 2,230 to 6,560 |

All rows: our calculation {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Eight doublings (256 times today's capacity) is an outer bound.

**Planning range** {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}: about USD 3,000 to 12,500 per t of protein in 2030, 2,400 to 10,800 in 2040 and 2,200 to 9,500 in 2050 (fast-case low end to central-case high end). The low end needs cheap capital, residue carbon and a heat-tolerant strain.
- **The floor, not learning, settles the soybean question**: about USD 1,870, 2.1 times soybean-meal protein.
- **Fishmeal parity needs fast learning or cheap capital.** The low end is below the August 2026 fishmeal-protein price from 2030 (central and fast cases) or 2040 (slow); it reaches the 2025 average (USD 2,625) only in the fast case, around 2040.

{{kn:kn-fungal-protein-floor}}

### F3.3.3 Capital-charge sensitivity

| Case | Change | Result with no learning, USD per t of protein | Comparable learning result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low-cost end | Capital charge 12% cut to 9% a year | 3,613 (from 4,049) | Central case in 2030 (3,557, two doublings); the slow case does not reach it by 2050 (3,640) |
| High-cost end | 18% cut to 12% | 12,027 (from 14,693) | Central case in 2030 (12,490) |

Our calculation {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Cheaper capital does as much as the central case's learning to 2030, with no technology risk, which is why concessional debt and guarantees are first-order levers; capital grants and guarantees also beat tax holidays in the regional evidence, at a 20% corporate tax rate [@RGN-01] {VN-adjacent|Medium}.

### F3.3.4 Precision-fermentation cost evidence

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Cost targets, food proteins | USD 10 per kg by 2025, USD 1 per kg by 2035 ("envisaged", not modelled) | [@FTB-23] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} (published target) |
| Peer-reviewed food-protein cost model, 2024 to 2026 | None found; a 2026 lactoferrin preprint was withdrawn | [@FTB-23] {general\|Medium} |
| Conventional lactoferrin | USD 750 to 1,500 per kg | [@FTB-41] {general\|Low} |
| Titre | Best published leghemoglobin 10.1 g/L against an "above 50 g/L" benchmark ([[app-s13-science]]) | {general\|Medium} |
| Continuous processing | Three times productivity, half the cost at 3,000 L (company claim) | [@FTB-17] {general\|Low} |

Our reading: high-value proteins pay now; functional dairy and egg proteins in premium blends in 2030 to 2035; commodity use only if costs near USD 1 to 2 per kg, which no published data yet support {general|Low} {fx:estimate}.

## F3.4 Carbon

### F3.4.1 Carbon price paths

Full table: `carbon_price_paths.csv` (19 rows).

| Jurisdiction and instrument | Year | USD per t CO2e | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vietnam, pilot trading (110 power, steel and cement plants) | Quotas 2025 to 2026; exchange pilot late 2026 to 2028 | Not published | [@ECF-12; @ECF-13] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Vietnam, World Bank recommended carbon tax | 2030; 2040 | 29; 90 | [@CLM-18] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} (published recommendation) |
| EU emissions trading | 2025 | 83 to 84 | [@ECF-15] {general\|High} |
| China national emissions trading | 2025 | 9.85 | [@ECF-16] {VN-adjacent\|High} |
| Korea emissions trading | 2025 | 6.6 to 7.0 | [@ECF-17] {VN-adjacent\|High} |
| Japan GX-ETS floor to ceiling (mandatory from April 2026) | FY2027 | 11.36 to 28.73 | [@ECF-18] {VN-adjacent\|High} {fx:projection} (official target) |
| Singapore carbon tax (S$45; S$50 to 80) | 2026; 2030 | 34; 38 to 61 | [@ECF-19] {VN-adjacent\|High} {fx:projection} (official target) |
| World Bank corridors (well below 2 °C; 1.5 °C) | 2030 | 63 to 127; 226 to 385 | [@ECF-20] {general\|Medium} {fx:projection} (published model) |

**Vietnam's scheme.** Decision 263/QD-TTg (9 February 2026) set pilot quotas above 243 Mt CO2e (2025) and 268 Mt (2026), offsets up to 30% and first surrender by 31 December 2027; full operation starts in 2029 [@ECF-12; @ECF-13] {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:projection} (official target). No price is published and agriculture and food are outside [@REG-59], so no feed or food plant faces a domestic carbon price before 2029 {VN-direct|Medium} {fx:signal}. Asian prices in 2025 were about one-eighth of the EU's.

### F3.4.2 Carbon cost per tonne of protein

Carbon cost = emission factor x price. It applies only if a price reaches embodied emissions; none does today. Script: `ecf_calc.py`, parts B and C; full table `carbon_cost_per_protein.csv` (14 rows). Soybean meal is taken at 46% protein (our assumption).

| Input | t CO2e per t of product | USD per t of protein at USD 25 / 50 / 100 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soybean meal, Argentina, no land-use change | 0.72 | 39 / 78 / 157 | [@ECF-21; @ECF-22] {general\|Medium} |
| Soybean meal, Argentina, GFLI 2022 (probably with land-use change; the citing paper does not state the basis) | 4.09 | 222 / 445 / 889 | [@ECF-22] {general\|Medium} |
| Soy, Brazil exports (average; frontier up to six times) | 0.69; about 4.1 | 38 / 75 / 150; 225 / 450 / 900 | [@ECF-23] {general\|High} |
| Fishmeal, Peru, delivered to China | 0.53 to 0.56 | 20 to 22 / 41 to 43 / 82 to 86 | [@ECF-24] {general\|High} |
| Cassava-based fungal protein, Vietnam, 2023 grid | 2.06 to 5.26 (3.8 to 11.7 per t of protein) | 94 to 292 / 188 to 585 / 375 to 1,170 | Our estimate [@ECF-25; @ECF-26; @COST-08] {VN-direct\|Low} |
| Same, 2050 plan grid | 1.49 to 3.28 (2.7 to 7.3 per t of protein) | 68 to 182 / 135 to 365 / 271 to 729 | Our estimate {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| Protein from power, electricity only, 2023 / 2050 grid | 46 / 1.1 to 1.4 per t of protein | at USD 50: 2,300 / 55 to 70 | Our estimate {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |

Fungal footprint inputs per t of product (our assumptions): 2.0 to 2.2 t of glucose at 0.65 to 1.10 t CO2e per t (Thai cassava starch plus hydrolysis); 0.17 to 0.20 t of urea at 1.0 to 2.5 t CO2e per t; 0.9 to 3.1 MWh of power; husk steam counted as biogenic; biogas captured; 45 to 55% protein.

### F3.4.3 What a carbon price does and does not change

- **For soy, the accounting method is the price.** At USD 50 per t, soybean-meal protein gains USD 75 to 78 per t without land-use change (9% of its price) but USD 445 to 480 at the GFLI value, which probably includes it (about half). For Argentine meal, 69% of Vietnam's imports, the two factors differ five-fold; we give both and do not average them {general|Medium}.
- **It barely touches fishmeal:** USD 41 to 43 per t of protein at USD 50, 1 to 2% of the price. Scarcity drives the fishmeal gap, not carbon (our reading) [@ECF-24; @FM-01] {general|Medium}.
- **It can hurt a cassava-based microbial protein**, which emits more than fishmeal (0.8 to 0.9 t per t of protein) and soybean meal without land-use change (1.6). Residue carbon, biogas and clean power come first {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Protein from power flips from worst to best only on a clean grid**, around 2045 to 2050 {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.
- **Nothing prices embodied feed emissions.** The EU border carbon mechanism covers fertilisers and hydrogen, both fermentation inputs, but not food or feed [@ECF-15] {general|High}. Buyers' scope 3 targets are the likelier channel, 2030 to 2040 {general|Medium} {fx:signal}.
- **Credits are not a financing route; green-debt labels are.** We found no approved protein-substitution method; the Climate Bonds Initiative launched Alternative Proteins criteria in 2025 [@ECF-27; @ECF-28] {general|Low}.

## F3.5 AI and bio-design

### F3.5.1 Demonstrated and claimed

Full table: `ai_biodesign_evidence.csv` (21 rows).

| Application | Result | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Serum-free medium, 14 components | 181% more cells at about the same cost; 38% fewer experiments than an efficient design of experiments | Demonstrated, lab | [@FTB-02] {general\|High} |
| Cost and growth trade-off | 23% more growth at 62.5% of the cost | Demonstrated | [@FTB-03] {general\|High} |
| *Pichia* protein production and cell media | 3 to 30 times fewer experiments than standard design | Demonstrated | [@FTB-04] {general\|High} |
| Autonomous enzyme engineering | Feed phytase 26 times more active at neutral pH in 4 weeks, under 500 variants | Demonstrated (abstract) | [@FTB-06] {general\|Medium} |

| Sector review | No good estimate of time saved; open data "the binding constraint" | Independent (June 2026) | [@FTB-01] {general\|High} |
| Media costs of USD 0.07 to 0.20 per litre; "years to weeks" | Not published or not quantified | Company claims | [@FTB-01; @FTB-24; @FTB-12] {general\|Low} |

**Reading.** Gains are real but narrow: about 1.6 to 30 times fewer experiments for specific problems. None lowers production cost at scale, and none removes Vietnam's bottlenecks: rules, shared pilot plant, feedstock conversion and scale-up capital {general|Medium}.

### F3.5.2 Compute, policy and the missing biofoundry

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| AI Law 134/2025/QH15 | In force 1 March 2026; a national computing centre, an AI fund, open data and a sandbox; no biotechnology line in the summary read | [@FTB-13; @FTB-14] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| AI Strategy, Decision 1671/QD-TTg (28 August 2026) | By 2030: about 1,100 EFLOPS (FP8), 500 MW of AI data centres, 10,000 advanced AI experts; AI in breeding, livestock and aquaculture; no fermentation or biofoundry | [@FTB-48] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:projection} (official target) |
| Compute | FPT AI Factory 38th on the June 2025 TOP500 (46.65 petaflops); Viettel DGX B200 from February 2026 with shared research access | [@FTB-15; @FTB-16] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Biotechnology policy | A 2025 national workshop on the 2026 to 2030 biotechnology agenda, where Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNU-HCM) set out a bioinformatics and AI focus for its own research; Directive 13/CT-TTg asks MAE for biotechnology clusters by December 2026; neither names fermentation | [@FTB-49; @FTB-50] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:signal} |
| Biofoundry | None found in Vietnam; no Vietnamese member on the part of the Global Biofoundry Alliance list we could read (A to L) | [@FTB-11] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Neighbours | Thailand: synthetic biology strategy and a proposed GMP food pilot plant; Korea: open K-Biofoundry and a synthetic biology law; India: a fermentation biofoundry for "smart proteins" | [@FTB-43; @FTB-42; @FTB-12; @ECF-33; @FTB-17] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |

**Reading.** Compute is no longer the constraint; wet-lab automation, data and bio-ML people are {VN-direct|Medium}. Design in Vietnam, build and test in a Korean, Singapore or Chinese biofoundry, is the cheap route to 2030 {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

## F3.6 Approvals and capital

### F3.6.1 Approvals

Novel-protein approvals counted from the approvals register (Singapore, US, Israel, Australia and New Zealand, China; Singapore list as at 14 August 2026, US inventory as of February 2026) [@RGN-03; @RGN-04] {general|High}:

| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 (part) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Cultivated | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 2 |
| Precision fermentation | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 |

Not counted: 2025 US letters for beta-lactoglobulin (Vivici; Shanghai Changing Biotechnology), lactoferrin (TurtleTree), ovalbumin (Onego Bio) and whey (Verley), with some dates in conflict; a proposed rule to end self-affirmed GRAS; 2024 US molecular-farming clearances; Korea's planned formal standards for cell-cultured food (announced June 2026) [@FTB-18; @FTB-19; @FTB-29; @FTB-31; @FTB-20] {general|Medium}. Vietnam has no new-food route: no implementing text says how a new-technology food obtains permission ([[ch07-rules]]); we found no approvals [@REG-01; @REG-02] {VN-direct|Medium}. Full list: `approvals_trend.csv` (44 rows).

### F3.6.2 Capital

| Measure | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Investment in alternative-protein companies (private and publicly traded), 2025 | USD 881 million (plant-based 450, fermentation 357, cultivated 74); down 20%, the first year below USD 1 billion in 7 years; over USD 19.5 billion from 2017 to mid-2026 | [@ECF-44; @HSC-10] {general\|Medium} |
| Fermentation | USD 632 million (2024) to 357 million (2025); precision share 33% (2023) to 66% (2025) | [@FTB-17] {general\|Medium} {fx:trend} |
| Cultivated | About USD 1 billion (2021) to 73.9 million (2025) | [@FTB-24; @FTB-01] {general\|Medium} {fx:trend} |
| Public | Cumulative at least USD 2.5 billion as of 2025, in at least 33 countries; China nearly USD 1 billion in 2025 of state (SDIC) investment in biotechnology facilities, food included; US federal USD 115 million (2024) to 11 million (2025); Vietnam absent | [@ECF-43] {general\|Medium} |

Advocacy data; we found no independent projection to 2050 and give none.

### F3.6.3 Patents expiring in the mid-2030s

Core families behind heme meat analogues (Impossible Foods, e.g. family 57325176, heme secretion, filed September 2014) and animal-free dairy (Perfect Day, family 54105986) were filed in 2014 and 2015, so the earliest members lapse around 2034 to 2035 on a 20-year term (our estimate, not a freedom-to-operate analysis) [@FTB-21] {general|Low} {fx:estimate}. Continuations extend some protection. Vietnam's only linked filing is a 2019 US application on yeast biomass [@HSC-06] {VN-direct|Low}; its route to 2040 is process know-how on local feedstocks and strains (our judgement) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

### F3.6.4 Distressed equipment

| Asset | What happened | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Meati (US mycoprotein) | 300,000 L of capacity, estimated to have cost Meati USD 15 to 20 million, sold for USD 75,000 in 2026, going to India | [@FTB-38] {general\|Medium} |
| NovoNutrients (US) | Closed 2025; assets for sale | [@FTG-10] {general\|Medium} |
| Believer Meats (US) | USD 154 million plant shut December 2025; status since unknown | [@FTB-24; @FTB-45] {general\|Medium} |
| Calysseo (China) | 20,000 t plant halted 2026 | [@FTG-06; @FM-13] {VN-adjacent\|Medium} |

Cheap second-hand tanks cut capital more than any learning curve before 2030, until the cycle turns {general|Medium} {fx:signal}. Clear customs and tax rules for used fermenters would let a Vietnamese feed venture use this in 2027 to 2030 ([[ch28-robust-moves]], RM-15) {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}.

## F3.7 Research pipeline

### F3.7.1 Global growth by field

OpenAlex articles and reviews; keyword lower bounds; 2026 to 24 September [@HSC-01] {general|Medium} {fx:trend}.

| Field | 2015 | 2020 | 2025 | 2026 (part) | Growth a year, 2020 to 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Precision fermentation | 8 | 9 | 188 | 234 | 84% |
| AI with food or alternative protein | 0 | 4 | 89 | 127 | 86% |
| Plant-based meat (reference) | 38 | 181 | 905 | 682 | 38% |
| Mycoprotein | 10 | 23 | 100 | 101 | 34% |
| Cultivated meat and seafood | 35 | 133 | 508 | 409 | 31% |
| Gas or CO2-based microbial protein | 6 | 24 | 62 | 58 | 21% |
| Single-cell protein | 52 | 101 | 235 | 221 | 18% |
| Molecular farming of food proteins | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | n/a |

All OpenAlex articles and reviews grew about 0.9% a year (2015 to 2025). Fields with approvals behind them grow fastest; gas fermentation and molecular farming stay thin.

### F3.7.2 Vietnam's position

| Measure | Vietnam | Comparators | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core basket per 10,000 national publications, 2015 to 2025 | 4.1 (72 works) | Thailand 13.4; Singapore 10.3; Philippines 5.6; Malaysia 5.4 | [@HSC-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Cultivated; precision fermentation; mycoprotein; molecular farming; duckweed protein (2015 to 2025) | 1; 2; 0; 0; 1 | Thailand 16; 7; 2; 8; 39 | [@HSC-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Gas-fermentation protein, 2016 to 2026 | 2 of 494 | China 105; US 64; Denmark 47 | [@FTG-14] {VN-direct\|High} |
| AI with alternative protein, 2016 to 2026 | 2 (reviews) | US 69; China 54; India 48 | [@FTB-10] {VN-direct\|Medium} |
| Protein design, 2019 to 2026 | 46, from 2 (2020) to 19 (2026, part) | Singapore 208; Thailand 130 | [@FTB-10] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:trend} |
| Screened genuine supply-side works | 7 (2015 to 2019), 9 (2020 to 2022), 13 (2023 to 2025), 11 (2026, part) | Raw counts overstate about twofold (40 of 91 genuine) | [@HSC-01] {VN-direct\|Medium} {fx:trend} |

**Intensity.** Vietnam's alternative-protein research intensity is about a quarter to a third of Thailand's, depending on the database: 4.1 against 13.4 works per 10,000 in OpenAlex, about a quarter in OpenAIRE [@HSC-01; @BIB-01] {VN-direct|Medium}. The two databases agree, so we give the range.

**Who does the work.** Before 2025, mostly aquafeed trials with Australian partners; in 2025 to 2026, mostly domestic food technology (IUH, HUIT, HCMUTE, Phenikaa, VAST), about 70% without foreign co-authors [@HSC-01] {VN-direct|Low} {fx:signal}. At about 20% a year, output would reach about 100 works a year by 2035, above Thailand's 2025 level (79 works); a mechanical extrapolation, not a forecast [@HSC-01] {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}. Institutions and partners: [[app-s7-research]].

| FW-07 | Contained molecular farming | 2035 to 2045 | Biosafety route under Decree 43/2026 | none | [@FTB-31; @AQF-22] {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| FW-08 | Cellulosic and one-carbon sugar at modest scale | 2040 to 2050 | A working Asian straw plant; hydrogen at USD 1.5 to 2 per kg (our signpost within IRENA's 2050 range) | T4 | [@NGF-11; @NGF-12] {general\|Low} {fx:estimate} |
| FW-09 | Cultivated seafood cells from Vietnamese species | 2040 to 2050 | Cell lines and media costs from abroad | T8 | [@FTB-24] {VN-direct\|Low} {fx:estimate} |

| FW-11 | Cell-free synthesis for food | Not before 2050 | A cost fall of several orders of magnitude | none | [@FTB-35] {general\|Low} {fx:wildcard} |

{{chart:chart-frontier-windows}}

**Readings** {VN-direct|Low} {fx:estimate}:
- **The windows open in sequence**: feed ingredients and design work to 2030, food ingredients and contract fermentation in 2030 to 2035, new carbon and seafood cells in the 2040s, bulk protein from power last.
- **Rules open more windows than technology does.** FW-02 to FW-05 all wait on a feed-list entry or a new-food route, both decided in Vietnam in 2026 to 2030.
- **The late windows depend on inputs Vietnam can prepare now**: residue carbon, clean power at named sites, cheap capital and process skills ([[ch28-robust-moves]]).
