# Deploying scoping.altprotein.vn

The site runs as the Cloudflare Worker `altprotein-scoping` in the Parker Vu Cloudflare account, on the custom domain `scoping.altprotein.vn`. Bindings are set in `wrangler.jsonc` under `env.production`:

| Binding   | Resource                      | Purpose                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `DB`      | D1 database                   | Page content, revisions, schema, CMS settings, users |
| `MEDIA`   | R2 `altprotein-scoping-media` | CMS media and backups                                |
| `SESSION` | KV namespace                  | Editor sessions                                      |
| `ASSETS`  | Worker static assets          | CSS, JS, fonts, logo, CSV data and zip downloads     |

The Worker upload is about 4.2 MB gzipped (EmDash, the bundled seed, and the build-time charts and data), within the 10 MB limit of the Workers Paid plan. Static assets (about 20 MB, including `public/data` and `public/downloads`) are served by Workers static assets.

## 1. Validate and build

Use the checked-in lockfile and Node.js 24, and run the checks in the README. Then:

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler login
pnpm build:production
```

`build:production` regenerates `src/generated/`, `public/data/` and `public/downloads/` from `report/`, then builds with the production bindings. Inspect `dist/server/wrangler.json` before deploying: it must name `altprotein-scoping` and the production D1 and R2 resources.

## 2. Automatic deploys (Workers Builds)

Workers Builds is connected to this repository. A push to `main` builds with `pnpm build` and deploys with `wrangler deploy`; other branches get preview versions.

`pnpm build` (`scripts/build.mjs`) selects the `production` environment of `wrangler.jsonc` when Workers Builds builds `main` (`WORKERS_CI=1` and `WORKERS_CI_BRANCH=main`), so production deploys bind the production D1, R2 and KV. Preview branches and local builds keep the default bindings (`altprotein-scoping-local` and `altprotein-scoping-media-local`), so code under review never touches production data. Setting `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` explicitly overrides this. If the Workers Builds build command is changed from `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`), keep this behaviour, or set the deploy command to `pnpm deploy:production`.

## 3. Replacement of the first edition (done on 24 September 2026)

Edition 1.1 replaced the first site's `report` and `chapters` collections with one `pages` collection, on a new database:

- Production `DB` is `altprotein-scoping-v2` (`0d53e2ec-79d3-4fd9-8638-ceb2cae66f86`, APAC).
- The edition 1 database `altprotein-scoping` (`24951da1-734d-45c8-91ca-8a72934de162`) is unchanged and kept as a backup. An SQL export is in the private R2 bucket at `backups/d1-altprotein-scoping-edition-1-2026-09-24.sql`.
- The content was imported with EmDash's setup endpoint (bundled content included). The first attempt stopped after 51 of 57 pages; rerunning it is safe because existing entries are skipped, and the second run created the remaining 6.
- The administrator registers a passkey in the setup wizard at `/_emdash/admin`.

To repeat this on a fresh database: export the current one, `wrangler d1 create <name> --location apac`, set its name and id under `env.production.d1_databases`, merge (or `pnpm deploy:production`), then complete the setup wizard straight away, including the bundled content. Until an administrator exists, the first visitor to the wizard can claim that role. Check: the admin lists 57 published Report pages; `/`, `/summary`, `/tom-tat`, `/report/ch11-plays`, `/report/ch18-scenarios-2050`, `/data/companies`, `/search?q=cassava`, `/glossary`, `/vi` and `/sitemap.xml` load; `/chapters/anything` redirects to `/report`; an anonymous `?_preview=x` request gets 403.

**Rollback:** point `DB` back at the old database id and deploy the previous release (the commit before edition 1.1) with `wrangler rollback` or a redeploy. Do not point the edition 1.1 code at the old database: its schema has no `pages` collection.

## 4. Content updates from a new package

Deploying never changes page text in the CMS. After deploying a new package, run `scripts/sync-content.mjs` as described in the README (plan first, then `--apply`), with an EmDash API token created by an administrator. Moving from edition 1.1 (57 pages) to v0.6 (81 pages) creates 66 pages, updates 15 and moves the 42 pages whose ids changed to the trash; their old URLs redirect (`src/lib/redirects.ts`). Moving from v0.6 to v0.7 updates 79 pages and leaves 2 unchanged; it creates and trashes none.

## 5. Subsequent deploys

- Build from the lockfile, run CI, and deploy the same reviewed build (`pnpm deploy:production`). Deploying never overwrites page text edited in the CMS.
- Changes to data, charts, key numbers, sources or the page structure are made in `report/` and ship with a deploy. Changes to page text are made in the CMS. If the same page text changes in `report/content` too, copy it into the CMS by hand (or on a fresh setup the seed carries it).
- Before a schema or dependency upgrade, export D1 and create an EmDash backup; store exports outside Git and `public/`.

```sh
pnpm exec wrangler d1 export <database-name> --remote --env production --output <private-backup-path.sql>
pnpm exec wrangler versions list --env production
```

A code rollback does not undo data migrations or content edits. Recover content through EmDash revisions and backups.

## Notes

- `workers.dev` and version preview URLs are disabled; the custom domain route is in `wrangler.jsonc`.
- R2 is private. Do not expose the bucket: backups may share it with media.
- The scheduled handler runs EmDash maintenance every minute. Observability is enabled; check Worker logs after deploying.
- No analytics, email sending, paid plugins or AI Search are configured. Previews are limited to signed-in Editors and Administrators.
